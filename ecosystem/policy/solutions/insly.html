                  Insly serves MGAs and small- to mid-size carriers. If you're
                  purely a distributor, Insly is overkill for you and not the
                  right fit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you have underwriters and sell through distributors
                  (brokers, agents, wholesalers, etc.), you'll find UIs and
                  features designed with you in mind.

                  If you are D2C or embedded, or if you want to integrate with a
                  distributor that has their own front end, Insly offers
                  JSON/REST APIs for all their functionality. Like most of their
                  peers they follow a microservices architecture.

                Insly's product builder suite allows you to design and test your

              <ul>
                <li>

                Broker and Underwriting Flows
              </h3>
              <p>
                Insly comes out of the box with customizable broker screens and
                underwriting flows. This business model is where Insly
                started—MGAs with manual underwriting, who distribute through
                brokers—so you can expect them to have thought through the
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the <strong>broker</strong> side, everything you set up in
                the product builder flows through automatically in the
                application UX: pages, questions, data pre-fill, dynamic display
                logic, inline validation, and the like. Colors, images, icons,
                and logos are all customizable, and white-labeling comes
                standard.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <strong>underwriting workbench</strong> includes everything
                we could think to ask for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Routing to multiple underwriting queues</li>
                <li>Prioritizing submissions within a queue</li>
                <li>
                  Underwriters assigning a submission to themselves so others
                  aren't working it
                </li>
                <li>Empowering underwriters with 3rd-party data</li>
                <li>Messaging between agents/brokers and underwriters</li>
                <li>Adding, requesting, and/or uploading documentation</li>
                <li>Approving and declining submissions</li>
                <li>Applying rating modifiers</li>
                <li>Maintaining an underwriting file</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Underwriting and issuance <strong>workflows</strong> are
                customizable as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                And you can <strong>allow underwriters to edit</strong> the rate
                and premium values in a quote, as happens more often in
                non-admitted business. If you use that feature, you can set up
                controls around it, allowing changes to certain fields, within
                given ranges, for specific teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of this comes with a
                <strong>highly flexible permissions framework</strong>.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can implement Insly with multiple brokerages or
                  distribution partners, and multiple underwriting units. Each
                  can have permissions only on certain products and see only
                  those products. And each can have their own unique set of
                  roles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Permissions can be assigned based on a user's unit, based on
                  their roles, or just to the user themselves, and they can be
                  as fine-grained as an individual field.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can administer all of this yourself for your distribution
                  partners, or you can allow them to manage their own users and
                  passwords and who gets what role.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Everything you can do in an Insly UI is available as a JSON/REST
                API. They don't offer a D2C or embedded front end, but you can
                build your own, and many clients do. If you work with brokers,
                your product's rating engine is available as a standalone
                service which you can expose to partners.

                Insly handles
                <strong>both direct billing and agency billing</strong>. Within
                that they support common variations like installments and pay as
                you go. They handle payments by integrating with third-party
                payments processors.
                <a rel="external" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> is

                Insly offers a
                <strong>full double-ledger accounting module</strong> for
                premiums. That is to say, they don't handle the rest of your
                office in-flow and out-flow like operations or venture capital.
                They will integrate with your existing federal ledger for that,
                though.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond accounting, Insly will build a
                <strong>data warehouse</strong> to spec, with all the data
                needed to do statistical reporting, reproduce automated rating
                and underwriting decisions, and analyze your conversion funnel.
                Bordereaux and other common reports can be downloaded as is or
                tailored to your needs.

                for some Insly clients, and it might be for you as well. We do
                know that Insly captures limits, premiums, etc. on a per policy,
                per product, per risk level, which any actuary or insurance data
                professional will tell you comes in very handy. As with all data

                business. They can offer advice on product design if you're
                moving from manual processes to digital. Then they'll design,
                plan, scope, and build a full implementation, along with an
                initial bank of tests and any integrations. And they'll train

                easier and faster than if you were to learn the platform and
                start from scratch—though that is an option as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insly offers their modules a la carte. This way if you carve
                out, say, BI reports or claims, and use someone else for those
                functions, you're not paying twice. Their base package includes
                product design, underwriting, and distribution including all
                rates and forms, plus broker experience and premium accounting.
                What constitutes add-ons to the base package are BI reports,
                data warehouse services, and claims.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insly's APIs adapt to your insurance product configuration, but
                the process is not completely automated. There is some API
                upkeep involved on Insly's side. Accordingly, they charge a
                monthly maintenance fee if you rely on their APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Onboarding time with Insly depends on the complexity of your
                project. A simple monoline MGA setup might take 4–6 weeks. A
                multiline, multi-channel might take 3–4 months. If you're a
                full-stack insurer with complex integrations and an existing
                system of record to hook into, it might take 6 months or more.
              </p>
              <p>
                (Like many policy software vendors, Insly regularly has a
                backlog of new customers as well. We always encourage you to ask
                the vendor if timelines are tight. In Insly's case the wait is
                usually no more than 4–6 weeks. At time of writing in early
                November 2022, builds for new customers can start in January
                2023.)
              </p>
              <p>
                At any size, working with Insly does not require a development
                team—unless of course you're building your own front end atop
                Insly APIs. Even then, you can always contract with a provider
                like
                <a rel="external" href="https://www.unqork.com/">Unqork</a> or
                <a rel="external" href="https://www.mendix.com/">Mendix</a> to
                develop a UX.
              </p>
              <p>
                You <em>will</em> want to bring knowledge of your compliance
                requirements to the table, since Insly works internationally and
                may not be familiar with the nuances of your regulatory
                environment. And of course bring the folks on your team who know
                your product and business well, so Insly can translate that
                knowledge into software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, Insly didn't start off as a no-code platform at
                all. They started by addressing clients' needs, from highly
                detailed airplane insurance to double-ledger premium accounting.
                Later they found no-code to be the most powerful, flexible way
                to solve those needs, so they refactored their entire system
                accordingly. We still hear this consultative, detail-oriented
                approach come through in the way Insly talks about client
                engagements.

              <h2>Product Builder</h2>
              <p>
                Since their no-code product builder is one part of why you'd
                choose Insly, we'll outline it in more depth here, drawing from
                what we've seen in demos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insly's <strong>product schema builder</strong> lets you
                configure the bones of your product. What are you insuring? What
                are the fields? How will you ask about those fields (open text,
                drop-down, numerical range, etc.), and in what order? Which ones
                are required?
              </p>
              <p>
                All of this is configured primarily in text, as
                <strong>JSON</strong>. While JSON is more technical than a pure
                graphical UI, it leaves a plain-text, centralized record of
                what's been changed from one version to the next, all of which
                can be reviewed in a standard version-control tool like
                <em>git</em>. Insly <em>also offers a UI</em> to configure many
                common elements of your product.
              </p>
              <p>
                You'll configure your <strong>rating</strong> with a no-code
                interface as well. Insly rating formulas should be intuitive to
                anyone familiar with Excel. In fact you can
                <em>use Excel to configure your rater</em>—downloading the
                current rater, making tweaks, and uploading the revised version
                for Insly to implement.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can automate some or all of your
                <strong>underwriting</strong> within the rating engine—approving
                or declining based on rules—and of course you can refer cases to
                an underwriter. Referrals can be generic (to “an underwriter”),
                or you can refer them to specific teams or individuals. The
                underwriter will be notified by email or within the underwriting
                workbench itself, depending on their notification settings.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a <strong>testing</strong> module for the rating engine.
                You can collect a bank of test cases and run them automatically
                to ensure your rating and automated underwriting always work as
                expected as you iterate.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Forms and documents</strong> use
                <em>Microsoft Word for templating</em>, and can output to either
                Word or PDF. You can also build
                <em>outgoing email templates</em> that integrate with Microsoft
                Outlook.
              </p>
              <p>
                You then <strong>connect it all</strong> by telling the schema
                builder how to integrate with these other elements, along with
                anything external to Insly. Will this product use the Insly
                rater? Or do you want to use your own? Which documents should be
                generated when? What if any third-party data enrichment API
                calls should be made, and how should that data be used?
              </p>
              <p>
                When you work with Insly, as described above,
                <strong>they will handle the initial configuration</strong> of
                the platform. You don't need to learn the ins and outs of the
                system just to get your feet on the ground. Rather, the product
                builder is intended to enable you to move quickly once you've
                launched.
