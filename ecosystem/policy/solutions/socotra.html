                Socotra serves as a system of record for MGAs and carriers
                across multiple (P&amp;C and Life) lines of business. It’s best
                for teams who’ve raised enough funding to support Socotra’s unit
                economics, and have a small development team or are comfortable
                getting assistance from an SI firm on the implementation. Their
                vision is to be the first truly modern core policy
                administration system for insurtech MGAs and carriers of any
                size: cloud-native, API-based, true SaaS, and ready to go off
                the shelf.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondarily, maybe you are an agency, but you might like to own
                your own product in the future. In the near term you need a
                configurable, white-labeled quote flow and light CRM solution.
                For this Socotra offers the
                <a href="#socotra-unified-portal">Socotra Unified Portal</a> as
                a standalone product. Then when it comes time to build your own
                product, you won't need to tear out any of your front end; you
                just plug Socotra's core policy software platform into the back
                of it.

                handle the policy lifecycle from quote and purchase through
                endorsement, cancellation, reinstatement, and renewal. APIs
                include functionality like rating &amp; underwriting, document
                generation, creating invoices and marking them as paid, and
                basic claims and FNOL. You'll want to build your own workflow
                orchestration layer on top of these APIs. From there you can
                create front ends for consumers or brokers, or provision your
                own external APIs for distribution partners.

                to integrate with downstream processes—like printing an invoice
                when it's generated, enabling automated renewal processes, or
                sending data changes to an external DB. Webhooks and APIs are

                you a head start on the rest, Socotra offers an app marketplace.

              <p>
                If you have a team of developers ready to develop your
                customized stack, Socotra's back end and growing app marketplace
                may be just what the doctor ordered. Your team can build a
                workflow orchestration and integration layer on their openly
                documented, modern back-end JSON/REST APIs, and then develop the
                front end(s) you need on top of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                But if you're pressed for time or development resources, or your
                short-term front-end needs are not complex, consider also
                springing for their configurable agent and policyholder front
                end, the Socotra Unified Portal. The portal is a separate
                offering from the APIs and app marketplace, collectively called
                Socotra Core. Socotra Core has its own internal facing front end
                as well. The SUP is newer, the product of a strategic
                acquisition in 2022. It has benefits over the Socotra Core front
                end, and we expect more as they continue to aggressively develop
                it.
              </p>
              <p>Benefits of the portal include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  New business and service flows for agents, and new business
                  flows for consumers. Direct-to-consumer policyholder
                  self-service endorsements will be available by the end of
                  2022. The portal does not currently have an underwriter
                  workbench component; if you have intricate underwriting
                  workflows you can build these or integrate with a commercial
                  underwriting workbench.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A spacious, mobile-friendly design, with a uniform look and
                  feel across agent and D2C experiences, and built-in tracking
                  integrations like Google Analytics, Mouseflow, and the Meta
                  (formerly Facebook) Pixel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A lightweight configurable orchestration and integration
                  layer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Standard quote flow features like default coverage levels and
                  automated quote variations. By contrast, quote variations
                  exist in the Socotra Core UI, but they're more manual: Agents
                  copy a quote and make changes to it. And rather than setting
                  default coverage levels in Socotra Core, you simply have the
                  agent set them each time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Surprising quote flow features like
                  <a rel="external" href="https://www.glia.com/">glia</a> chat
                  integration for support from underwriters and CSRs (which can
                  be set up so the chat agent can see and interact with the user
                  session), and a button for agents to easily send partial
                  quotes to the consumer for completion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  More native support for roles, groups, and permissions than
                  you'll find in the Socotra Core internal UI. At time of
                  writing, the Socotra Core UI only has read-only, claims-only,
                  and full admin roles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  “CRM light” features to help manage customers. As a general
                  rule, some data is best kept outside your policy software back
                  end itself—data like notes on individual customers and
                  communications with them. The portal provides a lightweight
                  solution for this. You can also handle email and SMS from
                  within the portal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Full configurability of application flows and question logic
                  via JSON. Note that this is a separate step from product
                  configuration in Socotra Core for the moment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  White-labeling and fine-grained branding. If you work with
                  multiple agencies for example, you can brand the portal
                  differently for each. The portal supports the most common
                  branding elements like logos, colors, and fonts. If you need
                  to completely redesign the page, consider developing your own
                  front end.
                </li>

                Standalone Solution for Agencies
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Socotra Unified Portal is also available as a standalone
                offering. If you're an agency and don't yet need Socotra's
                backend APIs, the portal offers a configurable, white-labeled
                quote and policy management flow which you can connect in to
                your partners' APIs. Later if you're considering owning your
                product, you can purchase Socotra Core. The portal will be ready
                to integrate with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The SUP doesn't replace all the functionality of an agency
                management system and full CRM. You'll still want to think about
                things like pipeline management and prospecting, commission
                management, billing and payments, and, if you're a broker, maybe
                tracking down policies in multiple systems. But if you're
                seriously considering a pivot to owning your own product, you
                might talk to Socotra about whether and how the unified portal
                makes sense for you.

                    ><strong>data mart</strong></a
                  >, introduced in 2022, is a relational database you can access
                  with any MySQL client. You can query the data mart as you
                  would your own data warehouse. Or you can plug your
                  dashboarding solution directly into it—your Tableau, Looker,
                  or PowerBI—with a MySQL driver.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To supplement the data mart, Socotra
                  <strong>event streams</strong> capture everything that happens
                  in the platform in full detail. Their event streams are

                  events as they happen in real time. Either way you can then
                  funnel some or all of this event data into a data lake.

                  >
                  for things like financial transactions, risk exposure,
                  policies issued, commissions payable, claims (including
                  reserves and payable), and unearned premium. These are
                  available out of the box both via API and in their internal
                  UI. Still, Socotra customers we've spoken with often
                  eventually prefer to work directly with the data mart and
                  event streams.

                The Socotra Approach: An Analogy
              </h3>
              <p>
                An analogy might help describe Socotra's approach to policy
                software, in comparison with that of other vendors. Some policy
                software companies are like Apple with the iPhone, focusing on
                UX and owning the system from end to end because that UX is part
                of their brand. Socotra aims to be like Android: an open system
                with well built core components that enables insurers to create
                an ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you like that approach, Socotra might be a good fit. You'll
                need developers, or Socotra Services or a solutions integrator,
                to get you started. If you go with an SI, Socotra can help you
                get connected. If you bring your own developers, you can dive in
                with a

              <p>
                The number of developers you need to build an insurance program
                with Socotra may vary. Some teams working with Socotra on
                single-product launches have had just 3–5 developers. One
                incumbent insurer building an entire digital multiline insurance
                program on Socotra had dozens. But for the Socotra platform and
                core functionality, even that team only allocated a single agile
                team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Launch times vary, anywhere from a few weeks to seven
                months—again depending on how much the customer is building
                around the platform in terms of workflow orchestration,
                integrations, and UI.
              </p>

                Should you choose to take advantage of the Socotra Unified
                Portal, you can either configure it from scratch yourself or
                enlist Socotra's help for initial set-up. Documentation for the
                portal is not as robust yet as what you'll find for Socotra
                Core, but the team is aware of that and working toward full
                documentation parity. In the meantime they will make sure your
                team is set up for success at launch and beyond.

                Their plug-in approach has the benefits of other text-based
                configuration styles (see our
                <a href="/ecosystem/policy/consider/configurability.html"
                  >configuration write-up</a
                >), including the ability to use
                <a rel="external" href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> to track
                changes. But it has all the power and flexibility of a full
                programming language. That <em>does mean</em> you'll need
                someone familiar with JavaScript to write your plug-ins. But
                there are a

                are configured using an open-source language called
                <a rel="external" href="https://shopify.dev/api/liquid"
                  ><strong>Liquid</strong></a
                >, developed by eCommerce giant
                <a rel="external" href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>.
                Liquid feels similar to other templating frameworks like
                <a rel="external" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> (for the
                <a rel="external" href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> programming
                language) or
                <a rel="external" href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/"
                  >Jinja</a
                >
                (for
                <a rel="external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>).
                You're writing HTML and CSS, as you would for a non-interactive
                web page. But you add dynamic content in curly braces:
                <code>{{ like this }}</code>. Socotra adds to Liquid some well
                documented
                <a
                  rel="external"

                >
                of its own, for things like formatting, easy date/time
                calculations, and lookups.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some policy software vendors use Microsoft Word for templating
                and Excel for rating, since business users often know these
                tools. By contrast, Liquid templates are likely not something
                your business analyst or insurance product owner already knows.
                But if you have someone willing to learn them, they offer all
                the flexibility and precision of HTML and CSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                Socotra also offers a <strong>configuration studio</strong> to
                complement these code-based approaches. Any changes made in the
                configuration studio UI are reflected in the config files.
                Customers use the config studio to tweak and validate
                configuration changes and even to build entire products,
                depending on the complexity of the product. Or you can use it as
                an on-ramp to coding up more intricate projects. You'll find a
