                As a no-code solution built exclusively for insurance, INSTANDA
                appeals to small insurtech carriers and MGAs (or small teams
                within larger insurers) who value self-reliance, flexibility,
                and speed to market. They may be launching a startup or a new
                insurance program or product line. INSTANDA customers innovate
                their own insurance products, rates, rules, forms, policy
                lifecycles, and UX screens without waiting for external partners
                or IT resources to configure, test, and deploy them.
              </p>
              <p>
                INSTANDA also appeals to teams working to update their UX
                without adding developer overhead. You may be moving away from
                paper applications and want to deliver a modern online
                application flow quickly and easily. INSTANDA can offer you a
                configurable front end and connect to your existing system of
                record post-bind.
              </p>
              <p>
                You don't need developers to work with INSTANDA—though you can
                choose to bring your own for certain work; see
                <a href="#how-to-work-with-them">How to Work With Them</a>
                below. You <em>do</em> want to know what you want (or have
                someone who can help you with that). You'll want an insurance
                product owner or SME. You'll want someone to act as a project
                manager. And you'll want at least one team member with the
                technical moxy of a business analyst. But that describes most
                insurance teams.
              </p>
              <!-- modify internal links (filepath and extension as needed) -->
              <p>
                You can use INSTANDA as your system of record, or you can use
                them alongside one or more existing systems of record, for
                reasons we've traced out in our write-up on
                <a href="/ecosystem/policy/consider/modularity.html"
                  >modularity</a
                >. You can use their white-labeled, configurable front ends, and
                you can build your own solutions—like external APIs for channel
                partners, or embedded product offerings, with their JSON/REST
                APIs.

                INSTANDA is a no-code, configurable tool to build, distribute,
                and service insurance products. You can use it on its own as
                your
                <a href="/ecosystem/policy/consider/system-of-record.html"
                  >system of record</a
                >. Or you can use it alongside one or more existing systems of
                record, for all the reasons we discuss in our write-up on
                <a href="/ecosystem/policy/consider/modularity.html"
                  >modularity</a
                >. To say that it's a no-code tool for insurance doesn't fully
                capture the spirit of the tool the way a demo might, so let's
                unpack what that looks like and how it's different from other
                tools.
              </p>
              <h4 id="basic-insurance-product-and-data-model">
                Basic Insurance Product and Data Model
              </h4>
              <p>
                You build your insurance product within INSTANDA, from the
                ground up. If INSTANDA were just no-code—and not no-code
                <em>for insurance</em>—that might be a daunting proposition.
                You'd have to teach it the concept of a policy, a term, a
                coverage, a limit, a premium, and so on—and the work would
                likely cancel out whatever benefit you got from using a no-code
                solution! This might be daunting, but INSTANDA is no-code
                <em>for insurance</em>, and it comes with all of that preloaded.
                So “from the ground up” here just means telling it the coverage
                options, the limits, the questions you need to ask in an
                application, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                INSTANDA comes with the building blocks of insurance preloaded,
                but it tries not to make <em>assumptions</em>. So you can easily
                define products with policy terms of less than 6 months, for
                example. Or you can define new lines of business entirely.
              </p>
              <h4 id="rates-rules-and-forms">Rates, Rules, and Forms</h4>
              <p>
                You build your product's rates, rules, and forms in INSTANDA
                using their no-code configuration tool. Rating look-ups are
                Excel-based, and formulas should be intuitive to anyone who's
                used Excel. Underwriting allows for approvals, declines, or
                referral to underwriters with different levels of authority.
                Rule expressions are simple and clear. There's a no-code editor
                for dynamic form templates—and in a nice touch, you can also
                have a designer touch up the resulting HTML and CSS.
              </p>
              <h4 id="policy-lifecycle-awareness">
                Policy Lifecycle Awareness
              </h4>
              <p>
                For every part of your data model, every rule and form and
                rating calculation, you also specify <em>when it applies</em>.
                This is a natural part of insurance, but you may not expect it
                to be built into a no-code solution, and certainly not in such a
                thoroughgoing way. INSTANDA guides you through deciding that
                this question for example, comes into play only after an
                indicative quote, that question comes in after the bindable
                quote (it doesn't affect the price but is needed for bind), some
                rules only apply during a midterm adjustment, and certain forms
                are only sent at renewal. All these policy lifecycle moments are
                essentially triggers, or events, and you tag your rules and
                fields to tell them which events they apply to.
              </p>
              <h4 id="producer-facing-and-d2c-front-ends">
                Producer-Facing and D2C Front Ends
              </h4>
              <p>
                INSTANDA then guides you through building branded, white-labeled
                front ends, both D2C and agent- and broker- facing, for both new
                business and policy servicing.
              </p>
              <p>
                In front ends, configurable can mean different things to
                different vendors; some only have a UI for setting colors,
                logos, and fonts, and if you need something more customized you
                just need to build it yourself. INSTANDA has that, but also
                offers full configurability: Anything you can do with HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript is fair game. And of course whatever you do to
                polish the look and feel of your UX, the “bones” of the UI will
                respond dynamically to your product logic: the questions,
                question types, validation logic, conditional display logic,
                order, groupings, screens, and so on.
              </p>
              <h4 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h4>
              <p>
                There are a host of other little things INSTANDA gets right.
                We'd like to highlight a sample of them, even though they're
                hard to categorize per se:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can enact <strong>binding restrictions</strong> on very
                  short notice (less than a day), down to zip-code level,
                  without touching your core rater or underwriting rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Appetite logic</strong> can be made dynamic, relative
                  to the rest of your book of business in real time. INSTANDA
                  has customers who do this today.
                </li>
                <li>
                  OFAC <strong>sanctions checks</strong>, required in the US,
                  are included automatically at no extra charge. They can also
                  be overridden, since sometimes automated checks get it wrong.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This list doesn't mean INSTANDA's thought of
                <em>everything you need</em>, of course. We always encourage you
                to think through your needs and sit down with the vendor. But we
                hope these examples help you develop an initial sense of the
                maturity of the platform as a no-code solution for insurance.

              <p>
                Events and UX flows in INSTANDA have both APIs and webhooks
                associated with them:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  APIs in case you'd like to develop your own front end or build
                  an integration with a distribution partner
                </li>
                <li>
                  Webhooks to integrate with downstream systems, alerting them
                  of events like purchases or changes to existing policies
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Both INSTANDA's APIs and webhooks respond dynamically to the
                product model you specify: if you add annual revenue as a
                required question, for example, it becomes a mandatory field in
                the API and automatically flows through to your webhooks.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also configure third-party API calls out from INSTANDA.
                For example, if you choose to buy or build your own rating
                service, you can configure INSTANDA to call it for pricing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you make extensive use of INSTANDA's APIs and webhooks, you
                may choose to build a translation layer. A translation layer
                might listen for INSTANDA's cancellation webhook, for example,
                and hammer it into a format your system of record will
                understand—if you use INSTANDA alongside an existing system of
                record.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this kind of translation or integration layer is part of your
                implementation needs, INSTANDA will also be happy to help you
                put it together. See

                There are also many integrations you don't need to build

                for several common critical insurtech needs. As of writing

              <p>
                For data, INSTANDA offers a near real-time (NRT) operational
                data store (ODS).
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An <strong>operational data store</strong> is simply a clone
                  of your production data. This ensures that if Data Engineer
                  Daphne runs a resource intensive query against the data, it
                  doesn't slow down Broker Bob's work. Bob is working off
                  production data, and Daphne's using the data store.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In data work, <strong>near real time</strong> just means
                  delayed by a few seconds. That's to distinguish it from legacy
                  data stores that clone on a nightly (or less frequent) basis.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                INSTANDA customers have access to standard views of the contents
                of their data stores. The views are not to keep you from the raw
                data, but to clarify it. If you need to develop a more involved
                data pipeline, the INSTANDA team will work with you to get you
                what you need. Or you could create your own data lake and funnel
                INSTANDA's webhooks into it.

              <h2>How to Work With Them</h2>
              <p>
                You can get started with INSTANDA with a full build, a co-build,
                or a self built initial implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Full build</strong>: INSTANDA begins with a discovery
                and design phase with your team to understand where you are,
                what you need, and how to get there. Then they build a proof of
                value for you, a full initial implementation you can hit the
                ground running with. There are checkpoints along the way to
                establish progress. Then they hand over the product and train
                your team. Whatever work is not done by INSTANDA themselves is
                handled by partners coupled tightly with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Co-build</strong>: INSTANDA works with you to develop a
                custom plan to divide and conquer. What is your scope, and what
                is theirs? Implementation pricing reflects the division of work.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Self-build</strong>: INSTANDA trains your team from the
                beginning and you build it yourself. Like most vendors, INSTANDA
                prefers to assist with the initial implementation to ensure
                you're getting the most out of the platform from the get-go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initial implementations generally take one to four months,
                depending on complexity. Recent new customers, for example, have
                stood up a marine product in 30 days and a commercial auto
                product in 6 weeks, including telematics. Your implementation
                might be more complex if it includes several lines of business,
                several widely differing states, or intricate integrations.
                Later implementations are faster, as is generally the case with
                policy software platforms. One ambitious customer of INSTANDA’s
                built 38 products in a year.
              </p>
              <p>
                You'll want to bring an insurance product expert to the table,
                as well as ideas of what you want your various flows to look
                like. If you'd like a partner to think through those
                questions—for INSTANDA or any other vendor—Finsure would be glad
                to help.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developers with INSTANDA are optional: As we've discussed,
                INSTANDA has a solid configurable front end, and if you use them
                alongside an existing system of record they can help you build
                the back-end integrations. But if you want to handle any of that
                yourself you can bring your own dev team.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will want one or more business analysts with some technical
                aptitude. And if you want to do a lot with INSTANDA, it's
                helpful if those business analysts are
                <em>dedicated resources</em>. If you need help justifying the
                expense, think of all the developer salaries you're saving!
              </p>
              <p>
                As with many policy software platforms, INSTANDA pricing is
                generally a mix of initial implementation costs, a monthly
                recurring fee, and a percentage of GWP. The platform is usually
                one total cost, not broken down into modules. APIs and webhooks
                do not cost extra. At time of writing (December 2022), their
                operational data store is a separate cost you can skip, but we
                don't recommend going cheap on data.
