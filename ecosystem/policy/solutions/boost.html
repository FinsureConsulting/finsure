              <p>
                Boost takes a 3-prong approach to helping you launch your first
                or next insurance product as an insurtech MGA. The 3 prongs are
                a package deal, so if you don't need all 3 Boost's not for you.
                If you <em>do</em> need all 3, getting them from the same place
                has significant advantages, and Boost's white-glove treatment
                will help you get on your feet quickly. The 3 prongs are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Tech</strong>. Boost offers a full array of JSON/REST
                  APIs and webhooks for all standard insurance functions, from
                  starting an application to selling a policy to cancellations,
                  renewals, and endorsements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Product</strong>. To help streamline the process of
                  getting you to market, Boost owns the insurance product. This
                  is not a good fit for insurtechs whose core differentiator is
                  insurance product innovation. But if what you bring to the
                  table is UX, data enrichment, distribution, partnerships,
                  marketing—any of the other myriad ways tech can enhance
                  insurance—this strategy can be just right. Boost will help you
                  design and get approval for the product. Or for a particularly
                  fast and smooth launch, you can even use a product Boost has
                  available off the shelf.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Capacity</strong>. Once the insurance product's been
                  designed and approved, Boost has a pool of fronting carriers
                  and reinsurers standing at the ready to back it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Boost will also fit you best if most of your business will be
                straight-through processing, with no manual underwriting
                required. Boost <em>does</em> offer a webhook flow for manual
                underwriting of special cases: say, $5M limits when the default
                is $1M. But they provide the underwriters—as it's their
                insurance product. And the product is designed such that most
                volume goes through without need for an underwriting referral.
              </p>

            <!-- notice the horizonal rule (hr) added after each section -->

            <section id="what-they-do">
              <h2>What They Do</h2>
              <p>
                Boost addresses three problem domains at once: tech, insurance
                product, and capacity. This is not just a convenience for you,
                Boost's customer. It also streamlines relations with your
                capacity providers, and it enables a kind of white-glove
                treatment that's not possible otherwise.
              </p>
              <!-- add a compact horizontal rule (hr class="compact") before each 3rd-level header (h3), unless it's immediately after a 2nd-level header -->
              <hr class="compact" />
              <!-- include the id for the h3 level. this is a good practice because we may link to those headers elsewhere -->
              <h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>
              <p>
                Like most of their policy software peers, Boost is built on a
                solid microservices architecture. Each service has a familiar
                <a href="/ecosystem/policy/consider/APIs.html#jsonrest"
                  >JSON/REST</a
                >
                API endpoint, and all of that functionality is documented
                thoroughly in both plain English and code, with working examples
                and flowcharts, in their
                <a
                  rel="external"
                  href="https://boostplatform.io/boost_api_docs.html"
                  >public online documentation</a
                >. For the plain English and flowcharts, see their
                <a
                  rel="external"
                  href="https://launchpad.boostplatform.io/knowledge-center"
                  >knowledge base</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                By offering back-end APIs for insurance functions, Boost frees
                you up to spend your resources on a snappy user experience,
                integrations, distribution partnerships, and everything else. Of
                course you can also work with a provider like
                <a rel="external" href="https://www.unqork.com/">Unqork</a> or
                <a rel="external" href="https://www.mendix.com/">Mendix</a> for
                your front end. Or in some cases Boost can even provide a
                customizable, white-labeled front end to get you started.
              </p>
              <hr class="compact" />
              <h3 id="streamlining-capacity">Streamlining Capacity</h3>
              <p>
                Combining tech, product, and capacity in this way helps capacity
                providers as much as it helps MGAs. Providing capacity is
                fraught with risks:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  How do capacity providers know you're implementing the
                  insurance product as agreed, and as filed with the Departments
                  of Insurance?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How do they know you're staying within their risk appetite?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How do they know you'll be able to institute binding
                  restrictions quickly and accurately?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How can they be sure you're handling any number of regulatory
                  issues well, like sanctions checks or cancellation
                  moratoriums?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If your capacity provider integrates with your policy software
                provider, they just <em>know</em> these answers. And that easy
                trust means it's easier for you to get the capacity you need.
              </p>
              <hr class="compact" />
              <h3 id="white-glove-treatment">White-Glove Treatment</h3>
              <p>
                Because they own the product, Boost will handle all Department
                of Insurance filings. This shouldn't be underestimated; it can
                be a real hassle. You usually have to have an insurance product
                manager working with your fronting carrier to get these pushed
                through individually for each product in each state.
              </p>
              <p>
                But there are other advantages to Boost's set-up. Boost handles
                all carrier reporting and bordereaux for you. They can do this
                because they own the product and work with fronters and
                reinsurers on your behalf. They also handle common regulatory
                compliance scenarios like sanctions checks, cancellation
                moratoriums, and taxes and fees. All of this is in the best
                interest of both the MGA and the capacity provider—so why not
                have Boost handle it for both of you? Boost's particular 3-prong
                arrangement is what makes this curated experience possible, and
                the curated experience in turn benefits the arrangement. It's a
                win-win.

            <section id="how-to-work-with-them">
              <h2>How to Work With Them</h2>
              <p>
                Launching a brand new product with Boost can take 9 to 12
                months. But remember, that timespan includes designing the
                product, securing capacity, and getting DOI approval. The
                process can be much faster than that, especially if you work
                with a Boost product that's ready out of the box. One customer
                who already had their front end built—so it was just plug and
                play—and used a pre-existing Boost product reports being able to
                set everything up in two weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will want enough developer resources to build one or more
                front ends, any data enrichment and integrations, and any
                external APIs (for distribution channels)—basically anything
                beyond the underlying microservices. Much like
                <a href="/vendors/policy-software/socotra.md">Socotra</a>, Boost
                focuses on publicly documented, JSON/REST APIs for core
                functionality, and gets out of the way to let you do the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also worth a call-out is how Boost handles
                <a href="/ecosystem/policy/consider/data-access.html"
                  >data access</a
                >. Unlike some vendors, Boost doesn't provide a data warehousing
                or datamart solution. Since every transaction is handled via an
                API call, they expect you simply to keep a record of the calls
                you've made. We recommend you work with a data team or
                consultant (like Finsure) to set up your own data lake and
                analytics.
