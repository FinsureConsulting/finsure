                Solartis Insure is a full-service policy administration system,
                or PAS. It’s built top-to-bottom on a microservices
                architecture. It’s fully integrated with ISO electronic rating
                content. Unique in the market, Solartis also offers back-office
                support to get your systems running while you build your
                integration. In fact this back-office support (called Solartis
                Administer) is available whether you use Solartis Insure or not
                at all.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Solartis looks and feels like a large, established policy
                administration system vendor: They consider themselves a policy
                administration system, they've been around since 2004, and they
                have 500 to 1,000 employees worldwide. (For more on the employee
                count, though, see below!) It's true that you can usually count
                on a company with that kind of sustained focus on policy
                administration to be able to handle a lot of the nuances and
                edge cases you may run into as you build your business. Here, in
                a good way, Solartis fits the stereotype of a large policy admin
                system.
              </p>
              <p>
                But given their age and size, you might also expect them to be
                slow, inflexible, and monolithic—and in this case you’d be
                wrong! We all know insurance in particular can be a slow
                industry to adopt recent trends. So coming into our research,
                Finsure didn't expect a modern microservices approach here. And
                yet Solartis has the word “microservices” all over their
                website. What's a team to make of it?
              </p>
              <p>
                In our experience—from demos, docs, and correspondence—<strong
                  >their microservices marketing is not hype</strong
                >. Solartis has undergone a full-on,
                <a

                  >Amazon-style</a
                >, top-down rearchitecting. The platform is built on JSON/REST
                APIs, not SOAP/XML, and it's “microservices all the way down.”
              </p>
              <p>
                This combination of industry longevity and microservices
                architecture likely positions Solartis as a contender for many
                teams.

                  Solaris just for rating, for example, or for forms and
                  document generation. In this way you can use Solartis

              <p>
                To configure your product, Solartis provides a product
                management toolkit. (You may see it abbreviated PMT in their
                materials.) You use the toolkit to configure everything from
                your product data model to rates, forms, rules, and custom
                workflows. Most of the PMT is designed to be used by a business
                analyst. It has development, testing, and production areas; if a
                change you're making doesn't require changes to the rest of your
                ecosystem, you can test and release it all from within the
                toolkit.
              </p>
              <p>
                While most of the toolkit is designed for a business analyst,
                power users can take advantage of more technical features as
                well:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Python scripts</strong>. These are optional, but they
                  offer flexibility and power for a growing segment of
                  code-savvy actuaries and insurance product owners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Drools rules</strong>. Despite the whimsical name,
                  this well established, open-source rules engine framework is
                  actually quite powerful.
                  <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drools"
                    >Drools</a
                  >
                  is a highly scalable domain-specific language for expressing
                  business rules—similar to if-then statements (and similarly
                  straightforward) but more expressive. We've seen Drools used
                  to negotiate intricate coverage rules in complex D2C quote
                  environments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)</strong>.
                  Solartis uses BPMN to express step by step workflows. If you
                  haven't used
                  <a
                    rel="external"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation"
                    >BPMN</a
                  >, it looks much like a flow chart, with more structured
                  conventions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Anything you configure in the toolkit is carried out throughout
                the Solartis system: transaction-level microservices, workflow
                orchestration layer, and front ends. As you should expect, if
                you add or edit a question in your product definition, the
                Solartis front end will reflect that change. Or if you're using
                Solartis as a headless solution (option 2 above), you can code
                your front end to do the same.
              </p>

              <h3 id="bureau-integrations">Bureau Integrations</h3>
              <p>
                Several policy software vendors offer out-of-the-box
                integrations with rating bureaus, most commonly ISO. If this
                feature interests you, or if you want to learn more about it,
                please see
                <a href="/ecosystem/policy/consider/bureau-integrations.html"
                  >Bureau Integrations</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solartis's ISO integration follows best practices. You can clone
                an ISO product, along with rates, form logic and templates, and
                statistical codes. If you make changes, and ISO updates their
                product, you can keep your product up to date automatically. If
                there are conflicts, of course you resolve them manually. You
                can even clone sub-products off of your cloned ISO products, and
                changes will flow through from the main product to the
                sub-products.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, Solartis's ISO integration actually predates
                today's ERC 2.0 system—ISO's product that powers most other
                vendors' integrations. This allows Solartis to offer extra
                features like multi-state rating, in case you're considering
                writing ISO-based policies that span multiple states.

              <p>
                Apart from their policy software, Solartis also offers an army
                of trained insurance professionals as back-office support. For
                example, you may need help with a single underwriting workflow.
                Even if you're not using Solartis—or any modern policy software,
                in case you're just using email and spreadsheets—Solartis can
                outsource this work for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is quite a powerful offering in connection with their
                policy software platform. If you're just getting on your feet
                for an initial launch, Solartis can provide a low-tech
                back-office solution while you get up to speed with a high-tech
                one. And this option is available whether you select Solartis as
                your provider or not!
              </p>

            <section id="how-to-work-with-them">
              <h2>How to Work With Them</h2>
              <p>
                There are a number of ways to get started with Solartis,
                depending on your needs and where you are today.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you have developers on hand and time to build, you can dive
                  in with their platform-as-a-service option and develop your
                  front ends on top of it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you need to get started more quickly, you can use their
                  back office to support in the meantime, and/or start with the
                  full software-as-a-service offering while you build.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you want a more managed solution, you can start with the
                  full software-as-a-service option, and just stick with it!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, if you're currently on another system of record, you
                  can use Solartis's function-as-a-service option selectively.
                  This may be the first step in a fuller Solartis implementation
                  or a longer-term architectural choice, making use of their
                  product management toolkit and ISO integration to consolidate
                  product logic.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Solartis recommends allowing them to configure the system the
                first time through, and using their product management toolkit
                to clone, configure and create new products afterward. As with
                any system, it's much easier to modify an existing setup than to
                start completely from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finsure recently brought a client to consider Solartis. Solartis
                was able to confidently offer a 3-month timeline to get the
                client’s program into UAT. This was a complex, high-touch,
                non-admitted package product in multiple states. The timeline
                included rate, quote, bind and issuance, policy lifecycle, forms
                and document generation, billing and invoicing, reporting, and
                claims integration. This was for Solartis’s full “software as a
                solution” offering (see above). If you’re looking for their PaaS
                or FaaS solutions, reach out!
              </p>
              <p>Solartis’s pricing model includes 3 components:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An annual license fee based on the number of lines of business
                  on the Solartis platform
                </li>
                <li>
                  An annual usage fee based on the annual DWP processed through
                  the Solartis platform
                </li>
                <li>
                  A one-time professional services fee for the initial
                  configuration of your insurance products on the Solartis
                  platform
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Solartis releases upgrades to components of their platform on a
                quarterly to semi-annual basis. Upgrades are voluntary—you can
                refuse or delay them if you like—and they're componentized: You
                can accept one upgrade without taking another. You may sometimes
                prefer to receive updates on your own schedule. If you do,
                Solartis will work with you to develop a testing plan, and they
                will share their own test bank.
