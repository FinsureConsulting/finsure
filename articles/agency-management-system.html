							<h2>What is an Agency Management System?</h2>
							<p>An Agency Management System (AMS) is a program or software that helps coordinate projects, schedules, and people in an agency setting. It is designed to help the main office employees handle daily tasks from tracking hours worked by employees to calculating sales commissions. This type of software helps the owner run their business more efficiently and effectively too.</p>
							<p>AMS is used as a platform for tracking the activities of agencies represented by agent partners. The system deploys web-based tools to create an online presence for the agents and provide them access to various services, resources, and information that can help them improve their business operations. When utilizing an AMS, agent partners can access the system at any time and from any location. Each agent partner also has a personal profile page where they can create and store public information as well as post relevant content.</p>
							<p>Agent partners can take advantage of the tools provided by an AMS to manage leads, generate reports on sales activities, view commissions, track leads, manage contacts and mailings, share marketing materials created by partner companies, and more.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="section-c">
							<h2>What’s included in an AMS?</h2>
								<h3>Lead and contact manager</h3>
								<p>A lead and contact manager helps maintain information about leads and contacts that your agency had before signing up with the system. This includes any notes, emails, or documents that will help the team remember how you were introduced to the company, what leads you have presented to a client, or even any personal information about an individual (such as their interests or hobbies).</p>
							</section>
							<section id="c2">
								<h3>Project manager</h3>
								<p>A project manager allows users of the system to manage projects by working on them in different capacities. For example, you can assign a project to a salesperson and set them as the lead for that project. You can then assign other team members to work on the project as needed.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="c3">
								<h3>Management reporting</h3>
								<p>A management reporting feature will allow you to view data about your agency employees’ time, projects, and commissions. Many systems can produce more than one kind of report, including reports for different users within your company (EX. managers, owners, or employees).</p>
							</section>
							<section id="c4">
								<h3>Employee time tracking and billing</h3>
								<p>A time-tracking system will help you and your team keep track of the time spent on projects. Some people prefer to manage their own time while others opt to have time automatically tracked by the system. It all depends on what works best for your agency. Many systems offer to produce reports that summarize the information for employees based on your specifications. Reports can include a daily summary, weekly summary, or periodic summaries based on any specific period (EX. weeks, months, or quarters of the year).</p>
							</section>
							<section id="c5">
								<h3>Resource scheduling and client feedback</h3>
								<p>A resource scheduling and client feedback feature allow you to keep track of when your teams are working on projects. This can help you plan for meetings and reschedule meetings as needed. It also allows you to create reports that summarize the data about all projects for each team member.</p>
							</section>
						</section>

						<section id="section-d">
							<h2>How can an AMS help you?</h2>
							<p>An agency management system provides several advantages to a business that uses it. Consider, the great deal of time and money that an agency can spend managing its clients and employees. An AMS makes this process more efficient and effective. Let's look at some ways that agencies use an AMS to manage their resources and grow their businesses.</p>
							<p>AMS can be customized with specific agency needs in mind, allowing agencies to customize the system to their specific needs. This means you can choose the modules that best fit your agency. You may want to opt out of the payment processing module if you have another payment solution in place.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-e">
							<h2>Why would a company use an AMS</h2>
							<p>The AMS has been created for the sole purpose of gathering intelligence and resources. That's a great reason why an insurance company would choose to use an AMS to manage its resources. By using an AMS, they can gather information on who they are doing business with and what they need. They can also use the system to manage their people by assigning them special tasks based on their skills and experience, while still ensuring that clients are being treated fairly and professionally. Let's look at some of the benefits that an insurance provider can receive from using the AMS.</p>
							<section id="e1">
								<h3>Ability to run reports</h3>
								<p>An insurance company may wish to know how the sales process is working, what areas are doing well, and where improvements need to be made. An AMS can provide this kind of information quickly and efficiently. Reports can be run to see which leads are converting into clients, how many sales have been made, and if any issues arise with specific clients.</p>
								<p>In other words, to run your reports to see how much needs to be paid for each premium-bearing transaction, you can simply make a small change to the CMS by rewriting the queries. There is no need for reconciliation of transactions, as the system will always make sure that your money is calculated correctly by its settings.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="e2">
								<h3>Automating the agency</h3>
								<p>An AMS can be set up so that it automatically produces all information needed for your agency's daily management. In other words, you need to take care of only a few things, such as setting up accounts and creating reports. The system will take care of the rest. You don't have to interact with it to see your sales reports or estimate commission costs. You simply glance at the system's dashboard, which includes detailed information about your team's activities and revenue generated.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="e3">
								<h3>Shared services</h3>
								<p>With an AMS, you can now share your information with another agency and receive reports about their activities. This allows for more efficient and effective management of resources. After all, if one company has a better system that provides information more quickly and easily, then it becomes more efficient for both companies to use the system since there will be fewer steps involved. In this way, you can save time and money. Insurance companies that share resources need to use similar systems.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="e4">
								<h3>Effective policy tracking</h3>
								<p>Insurance policies are an important part of any insurance company. For this reason, an AMS can be set up to track policies on an ongoing basis. Insurance companies can create reports that summarize information about policies and make it possible to generate policy statements or other letters regarding a policy's status. For instance, an agency may track a policy's status and determine whether it has been paid, the status of any claims that have been submitted, and other information.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="e5">
								<h3>Easier time management</h3>
								<p>An AMS can be set up so that all employees are automatically logged into the system, which eliminates the need for employees to provide the same information repeatedly, which reduces paperwork and provides for more accurate tracking of time and resources. Employees are now able to enter new or corrected information at their convenience with a simple click. Insurance companies can also set up automatic reporting, which will take care of any discrepancies that could arise.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="e6">
								<h3>Support omnichannel communication with prospects and clients</h3>
								<p>This means that an agency can now communicate with clients and prospects through one form. Many insurance agencies use a variety of methods to communicate with clients, such as by phone call, email, and telephone; however, these methods are not always in sync. By using the AMS system, an agency can provide the information that it needs to its client or prospect instantly, which in turn will increase the level of customer satisfaction.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="e7">
								<h3>Identify cross-sell and up-sell opportunities, helping in increased retention and customer wallet share</h3>
								<p>AMS helps an insurance company identify cross-sell and up-sell opportunities, which the sales team can take advantage of. The AMS system has built-in data that can detect the customer's profile, interests, habits, and behaviors. By using this information, an insurance agency can find out what products should be offered to which clients and prospects based on customer data. This will help in increasing retention levels, increasing customer wallet share, and improving overall customer satisfaction.</p>
							</section>
							<section id="e8">
								<h3>Provide in-depth analysis and reports across different agency metrics</h3>
								<p>Insurance agencies want to be able to provide in-depth analysis and report on different metrics. AMS is capable of doing this. There are many metrics available, such as the number of contacts made with a customer or prospect, how many prospects and clients a salesperson has contacted this month, how many leads were generated by the sales team, and more.</p>
							</section>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-f">
							<h2>How does a team use an AMS?</h2>
							<p>The role of a team within an organization is to deliver value. This means that the team is responsible for producing results according to the specifications of its agency owners. Along with this, they must support their agency owners in any way possible, especially in terms of gathering information and resources that are needed to complete projects on schedule, as well as providing information about development progress or obstacles.</p>
							<p>An agency management system helps teams work together more effectively through the effective use of centralized information. Insurance agencies can use an AMS to monitor the progress of employees in their team and make sure that each employee is fulfilling his or her duties. Because all information is centralized, assigned tasks and completion dates are easier to track. If a team member starts working on his or her project, the manager will be able to see this in real-time.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-g">
							<h2>Best Practices</h2>
							<p>Yes, there are best practices that have been proven to work when it comes to using an AMS effectively. To begin with, to get the most out of any AMS, you need a team that is comprised of competent employees who know how to use the system effectively. Proper planning is also required, especially when it comes to setting up modules. This means you need to plan your project and lay out the steps involved and the resources needed. This planning should then be followed by the development itself.</p>
							<p>Now, you must thoroughly test and audit the system to make sure it will work as intended before implementing it into your organization. Once this is done, you must test and train your team before putting everything into action. The team must learn how to use the system and the benefits of using them. You need to make sure that each member of your team can efficiently perform his or her tasks with the help of an AMS.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-h">
							<h2>Pain Points</h2>
							<p>When developing an AMS, some insurance companies have tried to tackle the project using tools they already have on hand. These tools might be very useful, but they may not be adequate to build an AMS. If your employees have never used an AMS before, it will take them some time to get used to the system and learn how to use it properly. For this reason, training is essential. In addition, you may need to make improvements to the AMS over time and invest in your team's skills and knowledge.</p>
							<p>This means that it's a good idea to establish a long-term relationship with an AMS provider so that you can take advantage of their expertise as needed.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-i">
							<h2>How does an AMS work with a CRM?</h2>
							<p>CRM, or customer relationship management systems, are used to track client information. Insurance agencies can use a CRM to keep track of clients, but this alone is not sufficient to ensure a smooth workflow. If you want to be able to adapt your CRM in the most effective way possible while you're working with a client, which means that your AMS platform should also be used.</p>
							<p>Now the AMS will show which staff member is working on a client, so insurance companies can better coordinate their efforts and work together more effectively. In this way, the AMS can help insurance agencies to collect more client-related data directly from clients and make it easier for insurance companies to fill in any paperwork with this information.</p>
							<p>It's also much quicker to gather important client-related information on the spot as you work with a client. In addition, if you're an agency that manages numerous clients, it will prove valuable to have all of the necessary information at your fingertips. An integrated system, therefore, allows agencies to work more efficiently and effectively with clients.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-j">
							<h2>Costs</h2>
							<p>The cost of an AMS is primarily affected by the level of customization you want in your AMS and how many clients you want to manage simultaneously. The cost for a standard, a basic system will differ from one agency to the next and depends on all of the factors mentioned earlier. The cost, however, is unlikely to be too high or too low. Price is usually per user every month, this means that the cost will be directly tied to the number of users leveraging the software. The initial setup cost and ongoing maintenance fees will also depend on the specific needs of your agency.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-k">
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Now that you know what an AMS is, how it works, and what factors affect its cost, you can make a more informed decision about whether or not an AMS is right for your insurance agency. If you decide that an AMS is a way to go, be sure to do your research and find a reputable provider who can offer you the level of customization and support you need to be successful. A good AMS can make a big difference in the way your agency runs, so it's worth taking the time to find the right one, which will save you time and money in the long run.</p>
