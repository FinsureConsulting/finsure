							<h2>Definition</h2>
							<p>A payment processor is an essential component for any online business. It serves as a trusted intermediary between the customer and the seller, facilitating seamless transactions and ensuring the security of sensitive financial information. It's important to note that some payment processors prioritize the needs of the customer, while others cater to the seller. Regardless of their focus, the primary role of a payment processor is to process the payment, collect the funds from the customer, and deposit them into the seller's account.</p>
							<p>Most online stores can't process payments directly, which is why a payment processor is crucial. It enables the acceptance of various payment methods, including credit cards, checks, money orders, PayPal, and more. In some cases, merchants may have their own online merchant account with their bank and the ability to accept credit cards directly, in which case, they wouldn't need to use a separate payment processor.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-c">
							<h2>Costs</h2>
							<p>The cost of using a payment processor can vary widely, depending on the service. Some charge only per transaction, while others impose flat monthly fees. The price depends on the number of orders that the merchant accepts. Stripe, (the popular payment processor for new startups), and Square charge 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction. While PayPal takes 4.2% plus 30¢ internationally and 2.7% plus 30¢ for in-store transactions in the US. Fiserv charges 2.6% + 10 cents in-person transaction fee. On average, payment processors charge anywhere from 3 to 5% (which includes the company's fee, processing fees, and the average credit card processing fee per transaction) to accept credit cards.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-d">
							<h2>Best practices</h2>
							<p>When choosing your payment processor, there are a few things to consider:</p>
							<h3>Integrations Into Billing Tools (Invoices)</h3>
							<p>You need a payment processor that handles your e-commerce transactions and integrates with your billing system. This is a common requirement for many startups that generates automatic invoices for your customers. Stripe is one first-class integration with all of the top billing systems.</p>
							<h3>Further Integrations </h3>
							<p>While your payment processor collects or attempts to collect payments, your billing system will be the source of truth for all payment records.  Your payment processor will likely need to send information to other services/modules within your core tech that offers cancellation services such as Oden Terminator, your CRM, and your policy admin system.</p>
							<h3>Modern & Public APIs</h3>
							<p>Your payment processor should have a modern open API that is useful to the developer community. This is crucial for developers to implement their tools on top of the platform.</p>
							<h3>Reporting</h3>
							<p>Your payment processor should offer robust reporting and analytics with a clear and detailed breakdown of your sales.</p>
							<h3>Useful Error Codes (As Opposed To Generic Error Codes)</h3>
							<p>Generic error codes are vague and provide no insight into why a particular error has occurred. Error codes that include specific information about the nature of the problem allow you to resolve errors faster. For example, if a customer's CVC number fails, or your ZIP code is wrong, your billing system should alert you to the error and not fill the customer's order.</p>
							<h3>Additional Features</h3>
							<p>Many standard applications exist with payment processors for common things like bill-pay, recurring payments, refunds, and customer support. Before committing to a platform, It is integral to check if your payment processor offers these services. This saves you time and money in the long run.</p>
							<h3>User-Friendly Dashboard</h3>
							<p>Your payment processor should include a user-friendly and uncluttered dashboard with an overview of sales and other timely information about chargeback rates, disputes, and FAQs.</p>
							<h3>SSL Encryption</h3>
							<p>The payment processor should use a secure method of communication that protects your customers' information. Not all payment processors do this, so it is worth checking to make sure.</p>

						<section id="section-e">
							<h2>Pain points</h2>
							<h3>Integration issues</h3>
							<p>A common problem with payment processors is their lack of integration with the billing system. This causes problems when there is a discrepancy between their systems and your own. Some payment processors do not integrate with every service, so you may need to choose one that does.</p>
							<h3>Poor customer service</h3>
							<p>Common issues with payment processors stem from their customer service. If you do not receive responses to your inquiries, or unclear answers, it's a sign that you should move on.</p>
							<h3>Security threats</h3>
							<p>If your payment processor is not keeping up with the latest security threats, you're putting your customers' information (and your business) at risk. Some processors are more secure than others, but the ones that don't tend to be more popular due to their ease of use.</p>
							<h3>Credit card data theft</h3>
							<p>While most of these frauds are isolated to one payment processor, it's still a major pain point for companies. If your processor is more widely known, it’s not uncommon to be targeted by criminals. This is especially true if your processor runs on a closed or semi-closed system.</p>
							<h3>Excessive fees</h3>
							<p>Most payment processors will charge transaction fees, monthly fees, and other fees that can add up to be exorbitant for your company.</p>
							<h3>Not insurance specific enough</h3>
							<p>As insurance, you will need to handle payment situations such as out-of-sequence endorsements, the addition of coverage, cancel for non-pay, and you may elect to deal with lapse coverage, or installment payments either on your own or via premium financing.</p>
							</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-f">
							<h2>Alternative payment types</h2>
							<p>Many insurers in the D2C space collect only Credit Cards. If you are interested in collecting other forms of payment it is best to leverage a payment service that specializes in the following:</p>
							<h3>Cash</h3>
							<p>Oftentimes, this is the most convenient method for cash-based businesses. Cash is collected via in-store terminals and the process is quick and easy from both a business owner and customer standpoint. One drawback is that this is not widely accepted as a payment by insurtechs.</p>
							<h3>ACH</h3>
							<p>This requires a business to have an existing business checking account. The funds are then transferred via ACH from the customer's bank account to the invoice recipient. This is accepted by a few insurtechs offering commercial insurance.</p>
							<h3>Check</h3>
							<p>Checks are becoming less common as smartphones take over. Invoices can be printed on check stock and mailed to the customer who will then send it in with their payment. This can be very efficient if the size of a check is small and the specific type is not important.</p>
							<h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are growing increasingly popular as payment alternatives to credit cards. This payment method relies on existing blockchain technology and thus has multiple advantages in speed and cost over traditional payment types. While Crypto is gaining in adoption and use, it is not yet a widely accepted form of payment in insurtech.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-g">
							<h3>Agency billing</h3>
							<p>In insurance, agency billing involves an intermediary (such as an agent or broker) selling insurance products to customers on behalf of the carrier. When a claim is approved, the agency sends the customer a bill for the premium, which the customer pays directly to the agency. The agency then submits an invoice to the carrier for payment.</p>
                                                        <p>The commission structure for agency billing depends on the agreement between the carrier and the agency. Commissions can be based on a per-client or monthly basis, or a combination of both. Another payment method in the insurance industry is direct payment processing, where customers pay the carrier directly. In this case, the carrier reimburses the agent immediately upon approval of the claim. This method eliminates the need for invoicing, making it a convenient way for agents to receive commissions.</p>

							<h2>Gateway Processor</h2>
							<p>Think of a gateway processor as a bridge that connects two worlds. On one side, you have the merchants, who are eager to receive payments from their customers. On the other side, you have the acquirers, who hold the power to distribute the payments to the merchants. And that's where the gateway processor comes in.</p>
							<p>Like a skilled traffic controller, the gateway processor seamlessly directs the flow of information and money between the two sides, making sure that everything runs smoothly and securely. With a flick of a switch, the processor forwards the transaction to the acquirer, who then dispatches the funds to the merchants. It's a delicate dance of data and dollars, but the gateway processor makes it look effortless.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-j">
							<h2>Invoicing</h2>
							<p>Businesses use invoicing to track transactions and ensure timely payments. They send an invoice to the customer with details of the items or services and the amount due. Invoicing can be done in-house with software or through external services, including those provided by the gateway processor. Small businesses rely on timely invoicing to maintain cash flow, so invoices are often sent promptly.After receiving an invoice from the gateway processor, merchants decide how and when to pay the bill. This decision is made separately by both parties if the processor is external, but merchants with their processors need to decide on their own.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-k">
							<h2>Typical payments workflow</h2>
							<p>Whether made online, offline or as a mobile transaction, the typical payment workflow is as follows:</p>
							<h3>Step 1</h3>
							<p>After the consumer enters their information, the gateway processor initiates an authorization request to the issuing bank to verify if sufficient funds are available to cover the purchase amount. Upon approval, the consumer's funds are reserved, and the merchant can process the transaction.</p>
							<p>However, the consumer's purchasing decision is not just influenced by the product's price. The perceived security and trustworthiness of the merchant and their payment processing system are also critical. Merchants must prioritize data protection and use a secure payment gateway processor, adhering to industry standards to assure consumers of the safety of their personal and financial information.</p>
							<h3>Step 2</h3>
							<p>The merchant receives transaction information from their processor, which they scan to create a transaction slip. This slip contains a list of expected transactions from their customers. Additionally, the merchant may need to send an email or SMS message to the processor to confirm payment within a specific time frame.</p>
							<h3>Step 3</h3>
							<p>Once the processor receives payment, the merchant receives a transaction receipt. The processor then generates an invoice to reflect the total revenue from completed transactions, known as a "settlement." This process can take time, making it challenging for merchants to manage gateway payments while waiting for settlement information. Nonetheless, it is a crucial step that requires careful attention.</p>
							<h3>Step 4</h3>
							<p>Merchants must ensure they have enough funds in their account to cover a transaction. They track their transaction activity and balance with programs like QuickBooks and use invoices to cover the transaction amount. Larger retailers require immediate access to transaction information, while small merchants may not send out detailed invoices before payment. The payment workflow is important for all businesses, with efficient workflows catering to different needs. Whether manual or automated, the end goal is to receive payment and track financial transactions.</p>
