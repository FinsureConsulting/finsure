							<h2>What Is A Payment Processor?</h2>
							<p>A payment processor is an essential component for any online business. It serves as a trusted intermediary between the customer and the seller, facilitating seamless transactions and ensuring the security of sensitive financial information. It's important to note that some payment processors prioritize the needs of the customer, while others cater to the seller. Regardless of their focus, the primary role of a payment processor is to process the payment, collect the funds from the customer, and deposit them into the seller's account.</p>
							<p>Most online stores can't process payments directly, which is why a payment processor is crucial. It enables the acceptance of various payment methods, including credit cards, checks, money orders, PayPal, and more. In some cases, merchants may have their own online merchant account with their bank and the ability to accept credit cards directly, in which case, they wouldn't need to use a separate payment processor.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-c">
							<h2>How Much Do They Charge?</h2>
							<p>The cost of using a payment processor can vary widely, depending on the service. Some charge only per transaction, while others impose flat monthly fees. The price depends on the number of orders that the merchant accepts. Stripe, (the popular payment processor for new startups), and Square charge 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction. While PayPal takes 4.2% plus 30¢ internationally and 2.7% plus 30¢ for in-store transactions in the US. Fiserv charges 2.6% + 10 cents in-person transaction fee. On average, payment processors charge anywhere from 3 to 5% (which includes the company's fee, processing fees, and the average credit card processing fee per transaction) to accept credit cards.</p>

							<h2>Best Practices/What To Look For In A Payment Processor?</h2>
							<p>When choosing your payment processor, there are a few things to consider:</p>
							<h3>Integrations Into Billing Tools (Invoices)</h3>
							<p>You need a payment processor that handles your e-commerce transactions and integrates with your billing system. This is a common requirement for many startups that generates automatic invoices for your customers. Stripe is one first-class integration with all of the top billing systems.</p>
							<h3>Further Integrations </h3>
							<p>While your payment processor collects or attempts to collect payments, your billing system will be the source of truth for all payment records.  Your payment processor will likely need to send information to other services/modules within your core tech that offers cancellation services such as Oden Terminator, your CRM, and your policy admin system.</p>
							<h3>Modern & Public APIs</h3>
							<p>Your payment processor should have a modern open API that is useful to the developer community. This is crucial for developers to implement their tools on top of the platform.</p>
							<h3>Reporting</h3>
							<p>Your payment processor should offer robust reporting and analytics with a clear and detailed breakdown of your sales.</p>
							<h3>Useful Error Codes (As Opposed To Generic Error Codes)</h3>
							<p>Generic error codes are vague and provide no insight into why a particular error has occurred. Error codes that include specific information about the nature of the problem allow you to resolve errors faster. For example, if a customer's CVC number fails, or your ZIP code is wrong, your billing system should alert you to the error and not fill the customer's order.</p>
							<h3>Additional Features</h3>
							<p>Many standard applications exist with payment processors for common things like bill-pay, recurring payments, refunds, and customer support. Before committing to a platform, It is integral to check if your payment processor offers these services. This saves you time and money in the long run.</p>
							<h3>User-Friendly Dashboard</h3>
							<p>Your payment processor should include a user-friendly and uncluttered dashboard with an overview of sales and other timely information about chargeback rates, disputes, and FAQs.</p>
							<h3>SSL Encryption</h3>
							<p>The payment processor should use a secure method of communication that protects your customers' information. Not all payment processors do this, so it is worth checking to make sure.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="section-e">
							<h2>Pain points/Friction With Payment Processors</h2>
							<h3>Integration Issues</h3>
							<p>A common problem with payment processors is their lack of integration with the billing system. This causes problems when there is a discrepancy between their systems and your own. Some payment processors do not integrate with every service, so you may need to choose one that does.</p>
							<h3>Poor Customer Service</h3>
							<p>Common issues with payment processors stem from their customer service. If you do not receive responses to your inquiries, or unclear answers, it's a sign that you should move on.</p>
							<h3>Security Threats</h3>
							<p>If your payment processor is not keeping up with the latest security threats, you're putting your customers' information (and your business) at risk. Some processors are more secure than others, but the ones that don't tend to be more popular due to their ease of use.</p>
							<h3>Credit Card Data Theft</h3>
							<p>While most of these frauds are isolated to one payment processor, it's still a major pain point for companies. If your processor is more widely known, it’s not uncommon to be targeted by criminals. This is especially true if your processor runs on a closed or semi-closed system.</p>
							<h3>Excessive Fees</h3>
							<p>Most payment processors will charge transaction fees, monthly fees, and other fees that can add up to be exorbitant for your company.</p>
							<h3>Not insurance specific enough</h3>
							<p>As insurance, you will need to handle payment situations such as out-of-sequence endorsements, the addition of coverage, cancel for non-pay, and you may elect to deal with lapse coverage, or installment payments either on your own or via premium financing.</p>
							</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-f">
							<h2>How Should An Insurer Think About Alternative Payment Types?</h2>
							<p>Many insurers in the D2C space collect only Credit Cards. If you are interested in collecting other forms of payment it is best to leverage a payment service that specializes in the following:</p>
							<h3>Cash</h3>
							<p>Oftentimes, this is the most convenient method for cash-based businesses. Cash is collected via in-store terminals and the process is quick and easy from both a business owner and customer standpoint. One drawback is that this is not widely accepted as a payment by insurtechs.</p>
							<h3>ACH</h3>
							<p>This requires a business to have an existing business checking account. The funds are then transferred via ACH from the customer's bank account to the invoice recipient. This is accepted by a few insurtechs offering commercial insurance.</p>
							<h3>Check</h3>
							<p>Checks are becoming less common as smartphones take over. Invoices can be printed on check stock and mailed to the customer who will then send it in with their payment. This can be very efficient if the size of a check is small and the specific type is not important.</p>
							<h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are growing increasingly popular as payment alternatives to credit cards. This payment method relies on existing blockchain technology and thus has multiple advantages in speed and cost over traditional payment types. While Crypto is gaining in adoption and use, it is not yet a widely accepted form of payment in insurtech.</p>

							<h2>Agency Bill With Payment Processor Vs. Direct Payment Processor</h2>
							<h3>What Is Agency Bill?</h3>
							<p>Agency billing in the insurance industry is a process where an agent, broker, wholesaler, or producer, acts as an intermediary between the insurance company carrier and the customer. The agency provides insurance products and services to the customer, and when the carrier agrees to pay out, the agency sends a bill to the customer for the premium due. The customer then pays the agency directly, and the agency submits a regular invoice to the insurance company.</p>
							<p>The commission structure of agency billing is subject to the agreement between the carrier and the agency. It can be determined whether the agency will receive commissions on a per-client basis or monthly. In some cases, the commission structure may be a combination of both, depending on the agreement between the carrier and the agency.</p>
							<p>Another method of payment processing in the insurance industry is direct payment processing, where the customer pays the insurance company directly. In this case, the insurance company reimburses the agent immediately if they agree to pay out. The customer emails or faxes a reimbursement form to the insurance company, and the agent is paid directly by the insurance company. This method eliminates the invoice process, making it a convenient way for agents to receive commissions without the hassle of invoicing.</p>

							<h2>What Is A Gateway Processor?</h2>
							<p>Think of a gateway processor as a bridge that connects two worlds. On one side, you have the merchants, who are eager to receive payments from their customers. On the other side, you have the acquirers, who hold the power to distribute the payments to the merchants. And that's where the gateway processor comes in.</p>
							<p>Like a skilled traffic controller, the gateway processor seamlessly directs the flow of information and money between the two sides, making sure that everything runs smoothly and securely. With a flick of a switch, the processor forwards the transaction to the acquirer, who then dispatches the funds to the merchants. It's a delicate dance of data and dollars, but the gateway processor makes it look effortless.</p>

						<section id="section-j">
							<h2>How Does Invoicing Work?</h2>
							<p>Invoicing is an essential process for businesses to keep track of their transactions and ensure that payments are received on time. It involves sending an invoice to the customer, which outlines the items or services provided and the amount due for payment. Invoicing can be done in-house using accounting software like QuickBooks or through external invoicing services. The gateway processor, who handles the processing of payments, can also provide invoicing services. Timeliness is important in invoicing, especially for small businesses that need to keep their cash flow moving, so invoices are often sent as soon as they are available.</p>
							<p>When a merchant receives an invoice from their gateway processor, the merchant then has to decide how to pay the bill. If a gateway processor is separate from the merchant, then this decision can be made separately by both. However, if the merchant has their gateway processors, then merchants have to decide how and when to pay their bills.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-k">
							<h2>What Is A Typical Payments Workflow?</h2>
							<p>Whether made online, offline or as a mobile transaction, the typical payment workflow is as follows:</p>
							<h3>Step 1</h3>
							<p>Once the consumer has entered their information, the gateway processor will then initiate an authorization request to the issuing bank. This authorization request will ensure that the consumer has sufficient funds in their account to cover the purchase amount. If the authorization request is approved, the consumer's funds will be reserved, and the merchant will be able to process the transaction.</p>
							<p>It's important to note that the consumer's decision to make a purchase is not just based on the price of the product, but also the perceived security and trustworthiness of the merchant and their payment processing system. Consumers want to know that their personal and financial information is secure, so merchants must use a secure payment gateway processor and follow industry standards for data protection.</p>
							<h3>Step 2</h3>
							<p>After receiving transaction information from their processor, the merchant then scans the information. The merchant uses this information to create a transaction slip to send to the processor. In other words, they will create a list of transactions that they expect to receive from their customers. The merchant may also send an email or SMS message when the payment has been received, as most processors require this to be done within a certain time frame.</p>
							<h3>Step 3</h3>
							<p>Once the payment has been received and processed by the processor, the merchant will receive a receipt for the transaction. The processor will create an invoice that shows how much money was taken in through the completed transactions. This is known as a "settlement." It should be noted that it is not uncommon for this settlement to take some time to process. If a merchant needs to make payments on their gateway, it can be difficult when they are waiting on their processor to send them this information. This is why the settlement process sometimes takes some time to complete.</p>
							<h3>Step 4</h3>
							<p>For the final step, the merchant must ensure they have sufficient funds in their account to cover the transaction. They use programs like QuickBooks to track their transaction activity and their overall balance along with an invoice to cover this amount. This is why invoices may take some time to process.</p>
							<p>For large or small payments, the payment workflow is not that different. However, the difference will be in the time it takes to complete each step of the workflow. While a small merchant may be willing to wait several days for a transaction to complete, a big retailer will want their transaction information right away so that they can get their money and make other payments as soon as possible.</p>
							<p>However, companies and larger retailers are not the only ones that will complete payments. Small merchants also use invoice services to receive payment from their customers. The difference is that smaller merchants will not necessarily take the time to send out an extended invoice before receiving payment from the customer.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, the payment workflow is an important part of any business, regardless of size. It ensures that transactions are completed promptly and that merchants have the necessary funds to cover the transactions. The steps involved in the payment workflow, from receiving transaction information to verifying funds, are crucial to the success of any business. Companies can choose to complete the process manually or automate it using software, but the end goal remains the same: to receive payment from customers and keep track of financial transactions.</p>
