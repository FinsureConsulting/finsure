							<h2>Definition</h2>
							<p>Strategic partnerships in insurance allow companies to access data for pricing exposures, offer innovative products, and improve internal operations. Insurtech is a rapidly growing industry that is disrupting the traditional insurance industry. Partnering with an Insurtech company can provide access to new technology, customers, and markets. There are various types of partnerships in Insurtech, such as developing new products, accessing customer bases, or technology platforms. Startups are teaming up with insurance companies to bring new products and services to market, benefiting both parties. To maximize the potential of partnerships, it is crucial to choose the right partner and structure the partnership to benefit both parties.</p>

							<h2>Benefits</h2>
							<p>There are many benefits to working with other businesses. By partnering with the right companies, you can gain access to new markets, new customers, and new resources.</p>
							<p>When choosing a partner, it's important to choose a company that complements yours. For example, if you're a B2B company, partnering with a B2C company can give you access to new customers. Or if you're a small company, partnering with a larger company can give you the resources and expertise you need to grow.</p>
							<p>It's also important to structure the partnership in a way that benefits both parties. For example, you might agree to share resources, co-develop a new product, or cross-promote each other's products or services.</p>
							<p>Navigating a partnership can be tricky, but it's important to remember that you're both working towards the same goal: growth. By keeping communication open and being clear about your expectations, you can ensure that the partnership is beneficial for both parties.</p>
							<p>Insurtech is a perfect example of how businesses can grow bigger together via strategic partnerships. By working with the right partners, insurtech companies have access to new markets, new customers, and new resources.</p>
							<p>When it comes to insurtech, there are a few things you should consider before deciding to work with another team.</p>
							<ul>
							<li>The first is what each team can bring to the table. For example, Rikor.Io offers insurance and compliance software and consulting services and Obie Insurance offers a quoting engine designed for landlords and investors. And with Coterie Insurance, you can quote and issue policies in minutes. All three of these companies have something different to offer, so it's important to consider what each team can bring to the table.</li>
							<li>Next, you'll want to think about who will be doing what. It's important to have a clear understanding of each team's roles and responsibilities. For example, Rikor.Io may be responsible for the software and compliance side of things, while Obie Insurance may be responsible for the quoting engine. And Coterie Insurance may be responsible for the policy issuance. By understanding each team's roles and responsibilities, you can avoid any potential conflicts down the road.</li>
							<li>Now, you want to think about the best-case scenario outcome. What is the end goal you're hoping to achieve by working with another team? For example, maybe you're hoping to grow your business faster or expand into new markets. Whatever the goal may be, it's important to have a clear understanding of what you're hoping to achieve.</li>
							<li>Finally, you want to think about what could go wrong. What are the potential risks involved in working with another team? For instance, maybe there's a risk that you'll conflict with the other team's goals or objectives. Or maybe there's a risk that you won't be able to deliver on your promises. By thinking about what could go wrong, you can help prevent any potential problems down the road.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If you've decided that working with another team or company is the right move for your business, here are a few tips on how to make it work:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Define the terms of the partnership and what each party is responsible for.</li>
							<li>Set clear objectives and KPIs that you both agree on.</li>
							<li>Communicate regularly to make sure everyone is on the same page.</li>
							<li>Be prepared to make adjustments along the way.</li>
							<li>Following these tips, helps you create a successful partnership for business growth.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Setup</h2>
							<p>Strategic partnerships are key to the success of any business, but especially in the fast-paced world of insurtech. By partnering with another company, you can gain access to new technologies, talent, and markets. But it's important to remember that not all partnerships are created equal. Here are a few things to consider when setting up a strategic partnership.</p>
								<h3>Ownership</h3>
									<p>It's important to know who will have ownership over any intellectual property or technology that is developed as part of the partnership. This will help avoid any potential disputes down the road. For instance, if one company develops a new software application that is integrated into the other company's products, who will have ownership of that software? When you're negotiating the partnership agreement, it's important to be clear about who will own what.</p>
								<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
									<p>It's important to know who will be responsible for actually delivering the products or services that are part of the partnership. This will help ensure that there is a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities from the outset. For instance, if one company is responsible for developing a new product and the other company is responsible for marketing and selling it, that should be clearly stated in the agreement.</p>
									<p>Ensure that each company has a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities in the partnership. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no surprises later on.</p>
								<h3>Licensing</h3>
									<p>If you're partnering with another company in order to gain access to their technology, it's important to have a licensing agreement in place. This will ensure that you have the right to use their technology in your products and that they are compensated for it. Without a licensing agreement, there is a risk that the other company could stop you from using their technology or charge you a high price for it. A licensing agreement will help protect you from these risks.</p>
								<h3>Maintenance</h3>
									<p>It's important to know who will be responsible for maintaining any technology or products that are developed as part of the partnership. This will help ensure that there is a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities from the outset. For instance, if one company is responsible for developing a new product and the other company is responsible for marketing and selling it, who will be responsible for maintaining it? When you're negotiating the partnership agreement, it's important to be clear about who will be responsible for maintaining the products or technology.</p>
								<h3>Risk mitigation</h3>
									<p>One way to mitigate the risk of partnering with the wrong company is to start small. For instance, you could agree to work together on a pilot project before committing to a long-term partnership. This will give you a chance to see how the other company works and whether they are able to deliver on their promises. If the pilot project is successful, then you can move forward with a full-fledged partnership. But if it's not, then you can walk away without having invested too much time or money.</p>
									<p>When you're considering a partnership with another company, it's important to think about the risks and rewards. By being clear about who will own what, who will be responsible for delivering what, and how you will start small, you can help ensure that the partnership is successful.</p>

						<section id="section-e">
							<h2>Financial impact</h2>
							<p>It's crucial to consider the financial impact of a partnership when negotiating the partnership agreement. This includes determining who will be compensated for the products or services developed, whether one team will invest in the other, and how additional capital will be obtained. Intellectual property, such as data and APIs, should also be taken into account. Being clear about the financial aspects of the partnership can increase the chances of success.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-f">
							<h2>Operational impact</h2>
							<p>It's important to think about the operational impact of the partnership as well. For example, who will be responsible for customer service? How will you handle returns? What if one company wants out of the partnership? Using a partnership agreement can help you plan for these contingencies and make sure that everyone is on the same page.<p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-g">
							<h2>Best practices</h2>
							<p>When negotiating a partnership agreement, it is important to consider the best practices and potential pitfalls of partnering with another company. To ensure a successful partnership, it is recommended to work with teams that work at the same pace, establish a clear workflow, agree on timelines and objectives, and determine the ownership of intellectual property. Additionally, competition can be beneficial, but the companies must share the same goals. Finally, it's crucial to outline how to terminate the contract if things don't go according to plan. By taking all these factors into account, both parties can achieve their goals and have a successful partnership.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-h">
							<h2>Ideal types of companies</h2>
							<p>There is no universal answer to whether strategic partnerships are beneficial, as each company is unique and has different requirements. However, some companies might be better suited for success through strategic partnerships. Businesses that share similar objectives and work at the same speed, have well-defined workflows and clear intellectual property rights, may be more likely to benefit from a partnership. Insurance companies, for instance, can benefit significantly from partnerships, given the complexity and dynamic nature of the industry. By partnering with other companies, insurers can leverage their resources and knowledge, better understand risks, and create innovative products and services that meet their customers' needs. Ultimately, it's up to each company to decide if a strategic partnership is the right approach and to take appropriate steps to ensure success.</p>

							<h2>Examples</h2>
								<h3>Buckle - a distribution partnership</h3>
							<p>Buckle, an insurtech company, has partnered with Amwins Specialty Auto to offer rideshare auto insurance to gig economy drivers working for companies like Favor, GrubHub, UberEats, and Instacart. The partnership enables Buckle to access a new market and provide drivers with personal, rideshare, and delivery coverage in a single policy. Simultaneously, Amwins Specialty Auto benefits from reaching a new customer base. This partnership showcases how two companies can collaborate and provide mutual benefits.</p>
								<h3>Chewy - a distribution partnership</h3>
									<p>The partnership between Chewy and Trupanion is an example of how two companies can come together in order to provide a service that is beneficial to both parties. In this case, the partnership has allowed Chewy to tap into a new market, while also providing Trupanion with a way to reach a new customer base. With Trupanion’s patented software, Chewy customers will have access to improved pet health insurance and wellness plans. This partnership is set to benefit both companies starting in Spring 2022.</p>

								<h3>Chubb</h3>
									<p>Chubb is a large insurance company that offers a variety of products and services. One of their main goals is to provide insurance to under-served areas. In order to do this, they have partnered with Latin American insurtech startup Betterfly.</p>
									<p>Betterfly provides a digital benefits platform that helps companies reward employees for healthy habits. They also offer policyholders telemedicine, mental health and exercise programs. This partnership will help both companies reach more people and promote each other’s offerings. By 2025, they hope to reach 100 million people through this partnership. This is a great example of how two companies can work together to provide a service that is beneficial to both parties.</p>

								<h3>Lighthouse</h3>
							<p>Lighthouse, a software platform for landlords and tenants, has partnered with Topa Insurance Company to offer security deposit insurance. This partnership will enable tenants to purchase insurance instead of providing a large cash deposit, making the rental process more affordable and accessible. This exemplifies how strategic partnerships can benefit both companies.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-j">
							<h2>Growth opportunities</h2>
							<p>Insurance and insurtech companies are ideal for strategic partnerships due to the complex and ever-changing nature of the industry, which requires constant innovation to stay ahead. By collaborating, insurers can pool resources and knowledge to better understand risks and develop innovative products that meet customer needs. This is especially important as new technology players enter the space, bringing fresh ideas and expertise but lacking resources. By partnering with established insurers, startups can quickly bring innovative products to market and leverage existing distribution channels.</p>
							<p>Automated underwriting is common among new players in the insurance industry, but they lack the extensive data that established insurers like Progressive, Allstate, Travellers, and Liberty Mutual have. This gives the latter an advantage in developing new products and understanding risk.</p>
							<p>Insurtechs move fast and innovate, transforming the insurance industry into a more competitive landscape. To keep up, established insurers must partner with insurtechs to access innovative products and services quickly. This collaboration allows insurers to adapt to changing customer needs and gain a competitive edge.</p>
							<p>Regulation and compliance slow down insurers, making it hard to keep pace with technology. Partnering with regulatory experts provides insurers with the knowledge and expertise to navigate the complex regulatory landscape. Additionally, insurers can partner with customer acquisition and marketing specialists to expand their reach to a wider audience, turn data into actionable insights through data analytics, and access the latest technology through IT partners. Finally, working with cross-border experts will enable insurers to expand their businesses into new markets.</p>
