              <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>
                A fronting policy is an insurance policy that is written to
                cover a specific risk, but the risk is transferred to a
                reinsurer. This type of arrangement is most commonly used when
                the organization wants to maintain complete control over the
                claims process. Fronting policies are often used to manage
                workers compensation risk, automobile liability risk, and
                product liability risk. When a fronting policy is used, the
                organization can write a policy to cover the specific risk, but
                then transfer that risk to a reinsurer. This type of arrangement
                is most commonly used when the organization wants to maintain
                complete control over the claims process. By having the
                reinsurer take on the entire policy risk, the organization can
                maintain complete control over the claims process. Fronting
                policies are a type of alternative risk transfer that is most
                commonly used by large organizations.

              <h2>What is fronting?</h2>
              <p>
                When a company arranges for an admitted insurer to issue a
                policy on its behalf without the intention of transferring any
                of the risk, it is called fronting. The company doing this is
                called the fronting company. The risk of loss stays with the
                original organization or captive insurer through an indemnity or
                reinsurance agreement. However, if the self-insurer or captive
                fails to indemnify the fronting company, the fronting company
                would be responsible for honoring the policy obligations.
                Fronting companies usually charge a fee for their services,
                which is typically between 4 and 6 percent of gross written
                premium.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fronting arrangements allow captives and self-insurers to meet
                financial responsibility laws in many states that require an
                admitted insurer's evidence of coverage, such as for automobile
                liability and workers compensation insurance. Fronting
                arrangements can also be used with other types of business
                contracts, like leases and construction contracts, where
                evidence of coverage from an admitted insurer is required.
              </p>

            <section id="section-c">
              <h2>How Does a Fronting Arrangement Work?</h2>
              <p>
                A fronting arrangement is a type of reinsurance where an
                insurance company ("fronting company") agrees to issue an
                insurance policy on behalf of a captive insurance company. The
                risk is then transferred to the captive through a contractual
                agreement ("fronting agreement"). This allows the insured to
                receive a policy from the fronting company, but the risk is
                ultimately covered by the captive insurance company. When used
                in the context of automobile insurance, the fronting company
                would be an admitted carrier in the state where the insured is
                domiciled, and the captive would be based in another state. This
                allows the captive to take advantage of the state's insurance
                laws and regulations that are more favorable to insurers.

              <h2>What is a captive insurer?</h2>
              <p>
                Think of a captive insurer as an insurance company that is owned
                and controlled by its customers, and whose main purpose is to
                insure the risks of its owners. Customers in a captive choose to
                put their own money at risk, rather than using the traditional,
                regulated commercial insurance marketplace.
              </p>
              <p>
                To issue policies, a captive insurer often contracts with a
                licensed insurer, even if the captive would prefer to be the
                main risk-bearer. This is because it is usually illegal for an
                unlicensed insurer to issue policies. The captive insurer is an
                unlicensed, non-admitted insurer except in its own domicile.

              <h2>Why do captive insurers user fronting arrangements?</h2>
              <p>
                There are several reasons why a captive might choose to use a
                fronting arrangement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first reason is that it allows the captive to comply with
                state insurance laws. In most states, an insurer must be
                licensed to sell insurance policies. However, captives are not
                licensed insurers. As a result, they cannot legally sell
                insurance policies in most states.
              </p>
              <p>
                A fronting arrangement allows the captive to get around this
                problem by having a licensed insurer sell the policy on its
                behalf. The licensed insurer is known as the fronting company.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second reason is that a fronting arrangement can help the
                captive save money on taxes. In most states, premiums paid to
                licensed insurers are subject to premium taxes. However,
                premiums paid to unlicensed insurers are not subject to premium
                taxes. As a result, a captive can save money on premium taxes by
                having a fronting company sell the policy and pay the premium
                tax on its behalf. The fronting company will typically charge
                the captive a fee for this service, which is typically between 5
                and 10 percent of the premium.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third reason is that a fronting arrangement can help the
                captive reduce its risk of insolvency. In most states, an
                insurer must post a bond or other security to prove that it has
                the financial resources to pay claims. However, captives are not
                required to post a bond or other security. As a result, a
                fronting arrangement can help the captive reduce its risk of
                insolvency by having the fronting company post the bond or other
                security on its behalf. The fronting company will typically
                charge the captive a fee for this service, which is typically
                between 4 and 6 percent of gross written premium in the United
                States.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fourth reason is that a fronting arrangement can help the
                captive access the capital markets. In most states, an insurer
                must have a certain amount of capital (reserves) to be able to
                sell insurance policies. However, captives are not subject to
                this requirement. As a result, a fronting arrangement can help
                the captive access the capital markets by having the fronting
                company sell the policy on its behalf.

              <h2>Other reasons for using fronting</h2>
              <h3>
                Admitted coverages written (e.g., WC, Auto, employee benefits)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Many states require that an insurer have an admitted policy in
                place in order to provide certain types of coverage, such as
                workers compensation or automobile liability. A fronting
                arrangement allows the captive to comply with these requirements
                by having the fronting company sell the policy on its behalf.
                This type of coverage is typically written on a "first dollar"
                basis, meaning that the captive does not have to cover any
                deductible or self-insured retention.
              </p>
              <h3>Need for rated paper</h3>
              <p>
                In some cases, the captive may need to have its policy written
                on a "rated" basis in order to comply with state insurance laws
                or to meet the needs of its owners. A fronting arrangement
                allows the captive to have its policy written on a rated basis
                by having the fronting company sell the policy on its behalf.
                This type of coverage is typically written on a " quota share"
                basis, meaning that the fronting company and the captive share
                in the premiums and losses in a predetermined proportion. This
                simply means if the fronting company writes the policy on
                <a href="."
                  >a 10% quota share basis, then it will retain 10% of the
                  premiums and pay 10% of the losses. (refer to reinsurance
                  capacity article).</a
                >
              </p>
              <h3>Policy issuance and claims handling services</h3>
              <p>
                When a fronting arrangement is used, the fronting company
                typically provides policy issuance and claims handling services
                to the captive. This can be a significant benefit to the
                captive, as it can free up time and resources that would
                otherwise be spent on these activities. How these services are
                provided will vary from one fronting company to another. Some
                fronting companies will provide these services for free, while
                others will charge a fee for them. In most cases, the fee is
                based on a percentage of the premium.

                Broad range of in-house expertise, including tax, insurance,
                legal, and regulatory:
              </p>
              <p>
                The fronting company typically has a broad range of in-house
                expertise, including tax, insurance, legal, and regulatory. This
                can be a significant benefit to the captive, as it can provide
                access to this expertise on an as-needed basis. This type of
                arrangement is typically used when the captive is new or when
                the owners of the captive are not insurance experts. A fronting
                company can also provide valuable assistance in the event of a
                dispute with a regulator or an insurance company.

              <h2>What are fronting policies?</h2>
              <p>
                A fronting policy is a way for an insurance company to manage
                risk by writing a policy to cover a specific risk, but then
                transferring that risk to a reinsurer. This type of alternative
                risk transfer is most commonly used by large organizations. By
                having the reinsurer take on the entire policy risk, the
                organization can maintain complete control over the claims
                process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fronting policies are often used to manage workers compensation
                risk, automobile liability risk, and product liability risk. In
                each of these cases, the organization can write a policy to
                cover the specific risk, but then transfer that risk to a
                reinsurer. This type of arrangement is most commonly used when
                the organization wants to maintain complete control over the
                claims process.
              </p>
              <h3>Friction with Fronters:</h3>
              <p>
                Fronters are a great way for MGAs acting as captives to get off
                the ground running and launch a new product in a variety of
                states licensed by the fronting company. Fronters require a lot
                of information both upfront and on an ongoing basis including
                enough premium and loss data to produce bordereau’s. The
                fronters may wish for your company to integrate with their
                sometimes-manual processes and hold a lot of meetings all the
                while taking minimal to no risk. So, while fronters are a great
                resource to get off launched in multiple states with one or many
                products some MGAs may wish to outgrow their fronters and become
                licensed themselves.
