							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Third-party data integrations and enrichments can greatly enhance a business's leads, traffic, and sales as the third-party data is often more accurate and comprehensive than company data. Integrating this data into a CRM or sales system is also a convenient way to acquire new customers. However, businesses need to have a clear plan, including the business problem they are trying to solve, the cost of the project, and the data sets they want to integrate or enrich.</p>

							<h2>What are third-party data integrations</h2>
							<p>Data enrichment involves adding additional data to an existing dataset to improve its quality or value. This can be done by appending new data from different sources or by standardizing and improving the already present data. For example, combining customer information from sales calls with information from online interactions can help to create a complete picture of each customer.</p> 
							<p>Enriching data can be a helpful way to improve decision-making, as it can provide more complete and accurate information. It can also be useful for identifying patterns or trends that might otherwise be missed. However, it is important to ensure that the added data is of high quality; otherwise, the overall dataset may be compromised.</p> 
							<p>There are many ways to enrich data, and the most appropriate method will vary depending on the dataset in question and the goals of the enrichment process. However, some common methods include adding data from external sources, cleaning and standardizing data, or incorporating new variables into existing datasets. </p>
							<p>Primarily, data enrichment only refers to enhancing or supplementing third-party raw data so that it can be integrated with an existing data set. This is done to achieve multiple business objectives such as Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Business Transformation, or Customer 360. Data enrichment is a data integration technique in which data from multiple sources is combined and used to provide valuable insights. The data enrichment process involves adding new dimensions to existing data sets by incorporating additional information from external sources.</p>

							<h2>Why insurance/insurtech companies leverage third-party data integrations</h2>
							<p>There are many reasons why insurance companies might want to leverage third-party data. For example, they may be looking to improve customer segmentation, target new markets, or reduce fraud. Additionally, they may want to use third-party data to supplement their own data to create a complete picture of their customers. Below are a few other reasons.</p>
							<h3>They don't have years' worth of data (this is true for young companies who lack data)</h3>
							<p>The insurance/insurtech company may not yet have years of data on their customers. In this case, they can turn to third-party data providers who have amassed large databases of information on consumers. This will give the insurance company access to a wealth of data they can use to understand their customers better and make more informed decisions.</p>
							<h3>They can't leverage their year's worth of data (many companies data is siloed and not usable to drive action)</h3>
							<p>Sometimes, a company may have years of data on its customers but cannot leverage it effectively. This is often due to data being siloed within the organization and not accessible to the people who need it. In these situations, third-party data can supplement the company's data and help them gain a more complete picture of its customers.</p>
							<h3>They want to fill in the gaps</h3>
							<p>There may be certain information that the insurance company cannot collect on its own. They can turn to third-party data providers supplying this missing information in these cases. This will allow the company to have a more complete dataset that they can use to make better decisions.</p>
							<h3>Improve accuracy of underwriting & pricing decisions</h3>
							<p>In some cases, insurance companies may find that their data is inaccurate enough to make sound underwriting and pricing decisions. They can turn to third-party data providers supplying more accurate information in these situations. This will allow the company to make better decisions about risk and pricing that are based on more reliable data.</p>
							<h3>Risk mitigation</h3>
							<p>With accurate historical data, insurers can better predict the likely damage of an impending weather event. This helps them understand the relative damage done by different types of severe weather events in specific areas. By properly assessing this information, they can develop strategies to mitigate the risk posed by these events. When severe weather does occur, such as a tornado, flood, or hailstorm, having this data can help insurers more quickly and effectively process claims and get policyholders the assistance they need.</p>
							<h3>They want to verify their data</h3>
							<p>In some cases, the insurance company may have data on their customers, but they are not sure of its accuracy. In these situations, they can use third-party data to verify their own data and ensure that it is correct. This will help the company to avoid making decisions based on incorrect data, which could lead to problems down the road.</p>
							<h3>Fraud</h3>
							<p>More data can help reduce fraud in two ways. </p>
							<p>Better selection of risk exposures and understanding potentially fraudulent individuals: Increased data can help identify fraudsters before they apply for coverage. In some cases, this may be through the use of data analytics to flag certain behavior that is associated with the fraud. In other cases, it may be through data from third-party sources that can provide information on individuals who have been involved in fraud in the past.</p>
							<p>Before they become customers: In some cases, data from third-party sources can be used to identify fraudsters before they become customers. This may be through the use of data that is publicly available, such as court records. In other cases, it may be through the use of data from private databases that are not accessible to the general public. Either way, this information can be used to help the insurance company avoid approving coverage for individuals who are likely to commit fraud.</p>
							<p>After a claim has occurred, insurers and TPA (the parties responsible for handling claims) may employ special investigative claims units (SIU); their goal is to detect fraud. Data enrichment/integration may help aid SIU in detecting fraud. This is done by analyzing first and third-party data to identify claim patterns that may be indicative of fraud:</p>
							<h3>Customer prospecting- where to spend marketing dollars</h3>
							<p>Third-party data can help identify individuals who are likely to be interested in purchasing insurance products. This may be through the use of data that is publicly available, such as demographic information. In other cases, it may be through data from private databases that are not accessible to the general public. Either way, this information can be used to help the insurance company target its marketing efforts more effectively.</p>
							<h3>Better customer segmentation</h3>
							<p>Data from third-party sources can also help segment customers more effectively. This may be through the use of data that is publicly available, such as demographic information. In other cases, it may be through data from private databases that are not accessible to the general public. Either way, this information can help the insurance company better target its products and services to the needs of its customer base.</p>
							<h3>Improved risk assessment</h3>
							<p>Data from third-party sources can also be used to improve the accuracy of risk assessment models. This may be through the use of data that is publicly available, such as claims data. In other cases, it may be through the use of data from private databases that are not accessible to the general public. Either way, this information can help the insurance company more accurately assess the risk of insuring individuals and groups of people.</p>
							<p>When it comes to cross-marketing, price-optimization, or unfair pricing based on a misapplication of data, insufficient oversight of telematics programs could result in this information being used for purposes other than a consumer's driving history. For example, if algorithms tend to penalize night-time drivers, this could, in turn, lead to higher premiums for individuals who work night shifts – regardless of their driving history. This would be an unfair use of data that could result in higher prices for some consumers.</p>
							<h3>Enhance personalization</h3>
							<p>A customer-centric approach is when a company tailors its products and services to individual preferences and needs. This allows businesses to capture opportunities better and create a more personalized experience for their customers.</p>
							<p>Third-party data enrichment can help businesses gain a deeper understanding of their customers to create more targeted marketing campaigns that are more likely to resonate with individuals. This data can help businesses create a more personalized customer experience, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>

							<h2>Types of third-party data</h2>
							<h3>GIS- Geographic information system (address verification) (geospatial data)</h3>
							<p>This system captures, stores, manipulates, analyzes, manages, and presents all types of geographically referenced data. It is often used for mapping and location-based applications. Insurance companies may use this type of data to verify the address of customers and policyholders.</p>

							<h3>Telematics data- vehicle data</h3>
							<p>This is data that is collected from sensors and other devices that are installed in vehicles. It can be used for various purposes, such as tracking the location of a vehicle, monitoring driving habits, and diagnosing mechanical problems. Insurance companies may use this type of data to help assess the risk of insuring individuals and groups of people.</p>

							<h3>IOT data (Internet Of Things)</h3>
							<p>This is data that is collected from devices that are connected to the internet. These devices can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring the environment, tracking inventory, and controlling systems. Insurance companies may use this type of data to help assess the risk of insuring individuals and groups of people.</p>

							<h3>Wildfire data</h3>
							<p>This is data that is collected about wildfires. It can be used for various purposes, such as predicting a fire's spread, monitoring its progress, and coordinating resources. Insurance companies may use this type of data to help assess the risk of insuring individuals and groups of people.</p>

							<h3>Workplace safety data</h3>
							<p>When it comes to business insurance, data on workplace safety can be very helpful in assessing risk. This data can be used to identify trends and hazards so that companies can take steps to mitigate the risks. Workplace safety data can be collected from various sources, such as government agencies, private companies, and research organizations.</p>

							<h3>Climate (hail, agriculture)</h3>
							<p>This is data that is related to the climate. It can be used for various purposes, such as predicting weather patterns, monitoring environmental conditions, and planning for emergencies. Insurance companies may use this type of data to help assess the risk of insuring individuals and groups.</p>

							<h2>Cost of third-party data</h2>
							<p>The cost of integrating or enriching data can vary widely, depending on the project's specific needs. The cost may just be a few dollars per API call for a simple integration or enrichment job. However, for more complex jobs that require a lot of data, the cost can be much higher, potentially reaching into the thousands of dollars per year for premium data sets. The cost of data is often a major consideration when businesses plan their data strategy.</p>
							<p>Third-party data can be a valuable asset for businesses, but it is important to consider the cost before making any decisions. Integrating or enriching data can be costly, and the price of premium data sets can be prohibitive for some companies. However, the benefits of using third-party data can be significant, so weighing the costs and benefits carefully before making any decisions is important.</p>

							<h2>Best practices for developing  data enrichment/integration strategy</h2>
							<p>Now that we have looked at third-party data and some ways it can be used, let's look at some best practices for developing a data enrichment/integration strategy.</p>

							<h3>Define the business problem that you are trying to solve</h3>

							<p>The first step in any data integration or enrichment project is to clearly define the business problem that you are trying to solve. Without a clear understanding of the problem, it will be difficult to determine which data sets are necessary to solve it.</p>

							<h3>Use longer forms to gather more information about leads</h3>

							<p>To get the most accurate and complete data, it is important to use longer forms when gathering information from leads. This will ensure you have all the necessary information to make an informed decision.</p>

							<h3>Evaluate your data set</h3>
							<p>Once you have gathered the necessary data, it is important to take the time to evaluate it. This will help you determine which data sets are most valuable and how they can be used to solve the business problem.</p>

							<h3>Determine the cost of data enrichment/integration</h3>
							<p>As we mentioned earlier, data enrichment/integration costs can vary widely. It is important to determine the project's cost before making any decisions.</p>

							<h3>Make sure you have the necessary infrastructure in place</h3>
							<p>To successfully integrate or enrich data, it is important to have the necessary infrastructure in place. This includes things like data storage, data processing, and data visualization.</p>

							<h3>Consider using a data management platform</h3>
							<p>A data management platform (DMP) can be valuable for managing and integrating data. A DMP can help you collect, process, and analyze data from multiple sources.</p>

							<h3>Work with a trusted partner</h3>
							<p>When it comes to data integration or enrichment, it is important to work with a trusted partner. This will ensure that you get high-quality data and that the project is completed successfully. When choosing a partner, be sure to check references and reviews.</p>
							<p>By following these best practices, you can develop a successful data enrichment/integration strategy to help your business solve complex problems.</p>
							<p>The evaluation of the collected data is crucial in determining its value and the best way to utilize it. A simple API call or a data management platform can be used to process and analyze the data effectively. It is important to weigh the costs against the potential benefits before making any decisions. After the data has been evaluated, businesses can start integrating or enriching it. This can often be done using a simple API call, which is generally very cost-effective. Businesses that need more robust processing and analysis capabilities should consider using a data management platform (DMP).</p>
