							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Having worked with shelf PAS and teams who build their own PAS, we have gained invaluable knowledge and expertise in the areas of PAS - both commercial and specialty. With extensive research and experience in this area, we know first-hand what it takes to get a rating engine and quoting engine seamlessly integrated with your existing application stack.</p>
							<p>Are you looking for ways to improve your policy administration skills? If yes, then Policy Admin System (PAS) is the perfect solution for you. PAS is a web application that helps you manage policies and procedures across multiple departments within your organization.</p>
							<p>As a company grows, its policies and procedures become more complex. Managing them manually becomes challenging. Thatâ€™s where PAS comes into play. This software automates the entire process of creating, updating, and managing policies and procedures.</p>
							<p>Policies and procedures are essential for every organization. They ensure compliance with regulations and standards, provide clarity on expectations, and reduce risk. However, they also add complexity to the daily operations of an organization. As a result, it becomes difficult to maintain them effectively.</p>

							<h2>What are the functions of PAS</h2>
							<h3>1. It serves as a source of truth for policy information</h3>
							<p>Policies and procedures are created by different people in different locations. These documents may be updated at any time without proper coordination. The problem arises when these updates get out-of-sync. To avoid this situation, PAS provides a central repository for all the policies and procedures. In addition, it allows authorized users to access and update them from anywhere.</p>

							<h3>2. It facilitates collaboration among teams; allowing teams to administer policies</h3>
							<p>PAS enables organizations to create and share policies and procedures easily. Policies can be shared across teams or even individuals. This way, everyone involved in the creation and maintenance of policies gets notified about changes. For example, if a new employee joins your team, he/she will receive notifications regarding the latest policies and procedures. This makes it easy for him/her to comply with them.</p>
							
							<h3>3. Most policy admin systems can handle multiple lines of business while satisfy only one line of business</h3>
							<p>When we talk about policy management, there are two types of businesses â€“ those who want to focus on one type of business and those who want to cover many. While most policy management solutions cater to the first group, PAS caters to both. With PAS, you can have separate instances for each line of business. Each instance has its own set of policies and procedures. You can assign roles and permissions to specific users so that they can edit and view specific policies.</p>
							<p>For one line of business such as life insurance, you can use PAS to automate processes like adding new customers, processing claims, and renewing existing ones. On the other hand, if you have another line of business such as banking, you can use PSA to automate processes like opening accounts, approving loans, and handling disputes.</p></section>
							<h3>4. PAS compliantly write policies</h3>
							<p>Writing policies and procedures requires extensive research. Most companies spend hours writing them. But what happens when someone else modifies them? Or worse, what happens when they are not properly written?</p>
							<p>To prevent situations like these, PAS uses structured templates. Templates are pre-defined sets of instructions that help you write policies and procedures quickly. By using templates, you donâ€™t need to worry about writing them manually. Instead, you just fill in the blanks provided by the template.</p>
							
							<h3>5. PAS can be purchased software (vendor) can be built in house</h3>
							<p>PAS is not just a vendor solution. It can be developed in-house. If you do decide to build your own version, make sure to choose a robust platform that can support multiple lines of business. Also, consider building custom features that meet your unique needs.</p>
							
							<h3>6. Insurers can manage their entire portfolio through PAS</h3>
							<p>Insurance companies often have a large number of products. They also have a huge amount of data related to these products. Managing all this data manually would be extremely difficult. Thatâ€™s why insurers rely heavily on technology to streamline operations.</p>
							
							<p>Many insurers now desire more than ever a scalable extensible solution with modern public forward facing APIs, microservices, true cloud and true SaaS because they have experienced the timeliness, frustrations, and limitations of certain vendor offerings. When they look at PAS, they see an approach that provides them with a complete end-to-end solution that addresses their current challenges.</p>
							
							<h3>7. Multi-vendor architectural options</h3>
							<p>With PAS, insurers can choose from several different vendors depending on their requirements. For example, some may prefer to work directly with the vendor whereas others may opt to develop it themselves. It can be challenging to find a solution which delivers everything an insurer needs. However, PAS offers a flexible architecture that allows insurers to pick and choose the best fit for their business.</p>
							
							<h3>8. Record management</h3>
							<p>In recent times, policy administration systems have become the backbone of any insurerâ€™s operations. The system helps keep track of every activity performed on the policy. This includes information such as customer details, claim status, renewal dates, etc.</p>
							<p>The system also keeps records of changes made to policies. In case of dispute or litigation, these records provide valuable evidence. From the initial point of contact to the back office, PAS ensures that no detail goes unnoticed.</p>
							<p>Technology has transformed the insurance industry. Now, more than ever before, insurers must embrace new solutions to stay competitive. Successful Insurers can no longer afford to bear the cost of hardwired, outdated legacy systems, nor should they settle for limited functionality. From claims processing to underwriting to policy issuance, insurers are adopting modern technologies to remain relevant and profitable.</p>

							<h2>What is included in a Policy Admin System</h2>
							<p>When we talk about a policy administration system, we refer to the set of tools used to handle the administrative tasks involved in managing a company's insurance portfolio.</p>
							<p>You can buy/build these modules separately but the following are widely accepted as what is included in a Policy Admin System.</p>
							<h3>1. A Rating Engine</h3>
							<p>This module is responsible for calculating insurance premiums based on risk factors and other criteria. The rating engine will calculate premium rates using historical data and adjust those rates periodically. Many PAS companies let you bring your own to the table, while others offer pre-built ones. The choice really depends on how much customization you need.</p>
							<h3>2. Quoting engine</h3>
							<p>A rules engine is one of the most important components of a policy administration system. Rules engines allow users to automate processes by defining simple conditions and actions. They can be used to process claims, generate quotes, send notifications, etc.</p>
							<p>Insurer use this engine to determine appetite, eligibility, pricing, and coverage, making it possible to automate many manual processes.</p>
							
							<h3>3. Policy life cycle</h3>
							<p>From source of truth for policies, which is where all the terms and conditions of each policy resides, to policy renewals, cancellations, amendments, reinstatements, endorsement and policy issuance - policy life cycle is vital to any insurance operation.</p>
							
							<p>This module also handles managing all past and current policies, showing how a policy looked at a specific point in time, and allowing users to see what happened to it over time.</p>
							
							<h3>4. Data Carrier Reporting</h3>
							<p>This module integrates data input, reporting, and extending the health of systems by providing data warehouse capabilities. This module provides the ability for users to make use of powerful tools such as forecasting tools.</p>
							<p>Its ability to produce premium and loss data tied directly to policy details is the underlying factor behind its functionality, which helps insurers understand and manage their claims. This data will be sent in bordereau reports to internal and external stakeholders such as the carriers and reinsurers, as well as policyholders.</p>
							
							<h3>5.  Forms document generation</h3>
							<p>A forms document generation module helps insurers to create and manage documents for each policy. This module can be used to generate insurance agreements, entire policies, certificates, etc.</p>
							
							<p>The ability for the policy admin system to produce the correct documents for lifecycle events such as a declarations page at new business or renewals makes it possible for users to work more efficiently. When a document needs to be created, you can use the forms document generation module to facilitate this process.</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-d">
							<h2>What is not included or not always included</h2>
							<h3>Front end tools for D2C (quote flow)</h3>
							<p> This is a separate module and is usually developed by the insurer based on their needs.</p>
							
							<h3>Front end tools for Agency (broker flow)</h3> 
							<p>Front end tools for agency quote flow should be developed by the insurer based on their needs.</p>
							
							<h3>CRM (salesforce HubSpot)</h3>
							<p>The platform needs to have a strong CRM module that can be integrated with your policy administration system.</p>
							
							<h3>Billing</h3>
							<p>This module is also not included in the policy administration system. You will have to have your own customer relationship management module or utilize different third-party vendors for this.<.p>
							<h3>Accounting</h3>
							<p>This module is also not included in the policy administration system. You will have to have your own accounting module or utilize different third-party vendors for this.</p>
							<p>Other include: Payment Processor, Data enrichments, Agency Management System</p>
						</section>
						<hr>
						<section id="section-e">
							<h2>Which type of companies use a PAS</h2>
							<p>Whatever your insurance operations, a policy administration system can help you to operate more efficiently and claim less costs for every activity. In other words, any company that needs to charge for services provided to a third party (insurance) or works in insurance policy administration will benefit from using a PAS.</p>
							<p>Insurance product such as MGAâ€™s and Carriers can benefit from using a PAS because it helps them track policy details, generate quotes and maintain an accurate inventory of policies and claims. PAS is sometimes needed by embedded insurers but it depends on their size and structure. An embedded insurer is one which produces a limited range of products or services. In a situation such purchasing a flight, a car, a diamond ring - policy administration system can help in managing the quoting and claims processes.</p>
							<p>In other words, wholesalers, producers, agencies and brokers don't usually need the full capability of a policy admin system. Their business model, tasks and resources are different. Some brokers and agencies do not handle general insurance. However, they may benefit from specific functions such as quote indications and policy management.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="section-f">
							<h2>How do different team members at an insurer use a PAS</h2>
							<h3>Your underwriter may need to update a rate factor</h3>
							<p>Underwriters use a policy administration system to update rate factors to rate calculations. Rate factors include age, gender, class of business and the type of risk. This process is automated by the policy administration system.</p>
							
							<h3>Your engineer may need to resurrect a quote which has expired</h3>
							<p>Engineers use the policy administration system to review expired quotes and resurrect those. The policies which have expired are verified by the policy administration system.When you resurrect expired quotes, you can have the PAS send reinsurers quotes electronically. This allows you to shorten the reinsurance process and claim less costs.</p>
							
							<h3>Your data analyst may need to extract data to produce a bordereaux</h3>
							<p>The policy administration system generates bordereaux reports tied to policy data. These analyses can help your data analyst to uncover trends in the market. The report can be used to generate quotes and determine future coverage for a policyholder.</p>
							
							<h3>Your claims manager may need to evaluate if the policy was valid when an accident occurred for a new claim</h3>
							<p>Claims managers use the policy administration system to review policies for valid claims. They can look at the claim details, like the date and time, if it covered an eligible event. Claims were evaluated and examined by claims administrators in a PAS.</p>
							
							<h3>Your customer service advocate may need to do two different endorsements with two different effective dates</h3>
							<p>The policy administration system will generate the first endorsement and send it to policyholders. After that, your customer service advocate may need to do a second endorsement for the effective date. The policy administration system then generates the second endorsement and sends it to the policyholder with an effective date on a different day.</p>
							<h3>Your internal agent may sell a policy</h3>
							<p>The policy administration system can be used to do all of your internal agentsâ€™ activities such as quotes, renewals, reporting, etc. External and internal agents can also access the policy administration system. They can perform quote indications, renewals and other online services in the platform.</p>
							
							<h3>Your external agent may get a bindable quote</h3>
							<p>If you have a bindable agreement with an external agent, the policy administration system can generate quotes for your agent. As a result, you can cut your agent's book of business costs.</p>
							<p>For instance, if an external agent applies for a bindable quote and that agent approves the quote and bind, then his commission will be paid. If the applicant agrees to buy the policy, then a new business transaction is created in the platform. This new business transaction will trigger an automated workflow which calculates the amount of commission to be paid. The commission is charged to the client or policyholder.</p>
							
							<h3>Your insured may need to change their address</h3>
							</p>If you have enrolled a policyholder and they move, the policy administration system can be used by your internal agent to change their updated address.</p>
							<p>Since the information is stored in the system, it can be accessed by numerous team members, therefore streamlining operations and claim less costs.</p>

							<h2>How much do they cost</h2>
							<p>Policies administration systems are the one of the most expensive software applications in the industry. A PAS system costs tens of thousands per year to millions of dollars per year depending on the size of your business and the extent of their functions. This is why it's important to evaluate your software needs before purchasing a PAS system.</p>

							<p>A good number of PAS cost 5 figures per year, many cost 6 and a very select few are extortionately expensive and cost 7 figures per year. The cost of a policy administration software is based on your business size and the scope of functions it can handle. This is why it's important to evaluate your software needs before purchasing a PAS system. When you do so, ensure you only go for the cheapest PAS possible.</p>
							
							<p>It is equally important to understand the total cost of ownership. Does your price increase as gross written premium increases? Are there license fees per year? What do you need to purchase, integrate, or build to work with your PAS to do everything you need to do? Think about staffing especially related to servicing of the policies, understanding the costs for updating, training and support.</p>
							
							<p>Bottom line: make sure you do your homework as it's not "one size fits all." Also, remember you're only buying one software that can do a number of things, not just one function.</p>
							
							<p>In the long term though, it can help you save money by cutting your staff costs, reducing the time it takes to obtain quotes, keeping your underwriterâ€™s resources busy, and reducing your underwriting expenses amongst other mind-blowing benefits.</p>
							
							<p>Although PAS systems are software used to automate the administration and management of an insurance company, they also provide value-added features. These features include tools that help in underwriting, policy issuance, and claim administration. The underwriting system usually consists of valuation tools and risk analysis solutions.</p>

<h2>What are best practices</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Security is a major aspect of the policy administration system. It is important you build a strong and secure infrastructure to protect your business from external forces. The policy administration system uses a variety of security protocols and techniques to protect your data.</p>

<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>Ease of use is essential when creating a policy administration system. There are many different products that are made for different purposes, so it is important you choose the one that will work best for your business. For example, if you need to certify say a new policy, it must be easy to navigate through the pages of your PAS. </p>

<h3>Webhooks, RPC, and APIs: Webhooks, RPC, and APIs are used in order to implement the system. Webhooks</h3>
<p>The policy administration system sends notifications to applications or data sources registered in the platform via an HTTP request. It also enables multiple applications to interact via an enterprise service bus or third-party services.</p>

<h3>RPC and APIs</h3>
<p>The policy administration system uses the Representational State Transfer (REST) interface to transfer data. REST is a way of interacting through HTTP between a client and a server. It is built on top of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP 1.1).</p>

<h3>Self-service both for insureds and for customer service representatives on your team (make systems as self-service as possible)</h3>
<p>When you do a policy for your customer, you want to make sure it's a smart process so that it saves your company time and you don't have unnecessary paperwork.</p>

<h3>Understand roles and access who in your organization is allowed to do which functions. Having audit logs can help in the need of a lawsuit:</h3>
<p>You can have access logs for the various parties in your business that are using the policy administration system. It is important to have them, because if a serious lawsuit happens, you may need to look at who was doing what and when.</p>

<h3>Think about scenarios like rate versioning/multiple concurrent raters</h3>
<p>Some carriers have different pricing schemes, so you can have multiple raters and multiple concurrent raters working on the same policies. Your system needs to be able to manage that scenario.</p>

<h3>Think about scenarios like how your PAS, Billing, CRM and Payment processor will deal with a cancelled policy for non-pay</h3>
<p>The policies administration system needs to be able to deal with a cancelled policy and review it or charge them with a cancellation fee.</p>

<h3>Standardize policies</h3>
<p>Standardize the layout and the structure of your policies. Make sure your systems are identical to that of your competitors.</p>

<h3>Example have a specific set of coverages, endorsements, forms etc.,.</h3>
<p>You should be sure you have a set of standard policies and forms that are used across your company. This helps in standardization of your products and makes it easier for your clients.</p>

<h3>Being very intentional about customization</h3>
<p>Customers have different needs and it is important that your policies are customized for their needs. This helps because you will be able to give them a customized policy that suits their needs.</p>

<h2>How should a policy migration project be approached</h2>
<p>Insurance policy migration projects can be complex, expensive and time consuming. There are many risks that can occur during the migration process including:</p>

<h3>Vendor issues in terms of pricing, software and hardware compatibility.</h3>

<h3>Risk of manual errors made by underwriters due to a lack of expertise or a lack of thorough knowledge.</h3>

<h3>Lack of standardization and customization of forms, policies and procedures.</h3>

<h3>Lack of integration between PAS software and other systems that are used in the business.</h3>

<h3>Lack of a systematic approach to policy administration systems.</h3>

<h3>Lack of training and lack of monitoring in the new PAS.</h3>

<h3>Oversight and management issues regarding the financial resources.</h3>

<h3>Lack of proper calculations of key business processes like renewal plans, discounting, etc.</h3>

<p>First you should consider if you wish to keep your existing book of business on your current platform and put new lines/new policies on a new PAS (in-house or off-the-shelf). The cost of the staff to do this is significant. If you do decide to keep your existing book of business on your current platform, you may opt to manually export the existing data and load it onto a fresh install of the new PAS.</p>

<h3>Alternatively</h3>
<p>You bite the bullet and transition your policies either at renewal or in a phased approach. If so, you will first write new policies on your new system and ensure it can support your needs. Upon examination of this, you will then transition policies at renewal from old system to the new one. For this to take place you will need all policy history from your legacy policy admin system to map to new fields in your new PAS.</p> 
<p>There may be a need for data cleansing, deduplication, and/or mapping. Additionally, you may desire to offer new products lines that are available on the new platform but not yet in your legacy system.</p>

<p>In some situations, you may elect to use a hybrid approach. In other words, you would build a new installation of the new platform, but continue to use data from your existing platform for now. This might allow you to leverage your existing staff and processes. Additionally, the cost of transition is reduced by leveraging your existing IT department to create a new installation at a later date.</p>

<h2>How does the PAS fit into a tech stack architecture</h2>
<p>The policy admin system PAS, represents a large part of your core tech stack and architecture but not everything your company will need will be housed within the PAS. You may have data warehouses, lakes, enrichment tools, CRM, billing, accounting, payment processors, sanctions check, a front-end quote flow etc., Many of these tools will need to be interfaced with your PAS. The data warehouse may have information that is not PAS secure; you may also have to interface with external data sources, like the IRS, SEC etc.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that you want to logically separate the data and flow of your PAS and other systems. You may also want to consider creating separate databases for these external systems such as the IRS etc.</p>
</section>
						<hr>
<section id="section-k">
<h2>Should I buy or build a PAS</h2>
<p>The decision to purchase or build your PAS comes down to a few key factors. But the real question is what you want to be when your company grows up? Do you want to be a technology company which leverages tech or do you want to be an insurance company which leverages technology?</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong answer, we work with teams who build and those who buy. If you are looking to be a technology company then you may build it in-house. If you are looking to leverage external resources, then you may consider buying. This is because you need to look at the future of your company and the resources you have; you need a roadmap.</p>

<h2>Key factors/considerations for building</h2>
<h3>Your team knows what they need to build:</h3>
<p>If you have a team which knows what they need to build, which has the resources and time, then you may look at building.</p>

<h3>Your team has the time, money, and resources to build</h3>
<p>If your team does not have the internal resources, time and money then you may look at buying.</p>

<h3>You have buy-in from underwriters and engineers</h3>
<p>If you have to ask your underwriters and engineers what they want, then it will be difficult if you are building.</p>

<h3>You build a system which is extensible and scalable</h3>
<p>If you build a system which lacks the ability to be extensible and scalable and if your business grows, then you will have issues.</p>

<h3>You are willing to maintain this system</h3>
<p>If you are not willing to roll up your sleeves, run around and maintain a system then you may look at buying.</p>

<h3>Do you think an off the shelf tool can satisfy your needs?</h3>
<p>Some companies have a need for a tool which may not be offered by an off the shelf vendor. In this case, you may have to look at building your own PAS.</p>

<h3>Do your investors expect you to build?</h3>
<p>Do you think this is the right mentality? If your investors expect you to build, you may look at building.</p>

<h3>You have experience in building</h3>
<p>If you were an IT developer, engineer or a tech product manager, then you may have the resources to build.</p>

<h3>You do not want to disrupt business process</h3>
<p>If disrupting your business process is something you want to avoid, then you may look at buying. You may still buy an off the shelf PAS but integrate with your in-house systems.</p>

<h2>Key factors/considerations for buying</h2>
<h3>What if your main engineer leaves?</h3>
<p>If your main engineer leaves and you are not able to hire a replacement, then you may look at buying. This is because building a PAS is not a one-person job.</p>

<H3>What if you spend all of this time and money only to have a tool which is not flexible, not extensible, not scalable, or breaks?</h3> 
<p>You may find that your PAS does not meet your needs.</p>

<h3>Do you want your ability to build new products (LOB), ability to expand to new states, or the ability to make small or major bug fixes reliant on vendors?</h3>
<p>If the answer to any of the above is yes, then you may look at buying.</p>

<h3>Do you want a proven solution with live customers?</h3>
<p>If you want a proven solution with live customers, then you may look at buying. With this you can leverage their experience and the interfaces, integrations, and data they have.</p>

<h3>What is the total cost of ownership?</h3>
<p>If the total cost of ownership is less than the benefit of owning, then you may look at buying. If it is equal and you want the flexibility to upgrade, then you may look at building. If it is more, then you may look at buying.</p>

<h3>How will my team work with the tool?</h3>
<p>Do you want your engineers and underwriters to use the same tool for tech and policy? If yes, then you may look at building. If no, then you may look at buying. This is because you have different business objectives. You may also want to look at a technology that has the ability to interface with your other systems by using APIs and/or other technologies.</p>

<h3>What about speed to market?</h3>
<p>If speed to market is a priority (i.e., it takes six months to build), then you may look at buying. No matter how you look at it, the build process is lengthy and you do not want to delay your launch.</p>

<h3>It does not make sense in this day and age to build a payment processor when there are tools which focus on this solely. Is this your approach to PAS?</h3>
<p>When you are in the tech business, you are going to need a payment processor. If you do not have one and you do not want to build one, then look at buying from a reliable vendor. Any vendor can offer you a payment processor but only a few can guarantee the performance, reliability, support, and partnerships for your PAS.</p>
