							<h2>What is (re)insurance capacity</h2>
							<p>A wide variety of terms in insurance can be difficult to understand, but one that is important to know is insurance capacity. Insurance capacity refers to the maximum amount of coverage that a company can provide or that the market can offer. After a large event, such as 9/11, there may be a lack of insurance capacity in the market. This means that companies are unable or unwilling to provide the same amount of coverage as before the event. When buying a renters insurance policy, the insurer looks at the risk that you present as an individual and also at how much money they have available to pay total claims. They consider their future liabilities and how much money they need to take in to keep claims reserves at acceptable levels. All of these factors are taken into account when setting prices for an insurance policy such as renters' insurance.</p>
							<p>According to IRMI, insurance capacity "is the largest amount of insurance that a company or the market is able to write." In other words, it's the maximum limit on the amount of coverage that an insurer can provide. This limit is determined by several factors, including the amount of money that the company has available to pay claims, its future liabilities, and how much money they need to keep in reserves.</p>
							<p>All of these factors play a role in how much coverage a company can provide. When there's a large event, such as a hurricane or terrorist attack, the demand for insurance goes up. This can lead to a lack of insurance capacity in the market. Companies are unable or unwilling to provide the same amount of coverage as they did before the event. This can be a problem for insurtechs seeking capacity. It can also be a problem for consumers who are looking to purchase or renew their policy. After a large event, there may not be enough insurance capacity in the market to go around. This can lead to higher prices and less coverage for consumers.</p>

							<h2>Insurance capacity effect on gross written premium</h2>
							<p>The capacity for underwriting cyber risk coverage is not limited by the availability of insurance or reinsurance contracts. Rather, it is determined by the gross written premium (GWP) and total exposure of the coverage or form. Carriers are willing to write coverage for risks that have improved their security posture, but those that have not done so may find that their policies are canceled. The ransomware attacks of recent years have not changed capacity one bit, but they have increased premiums. This, in turn, has increased the capacity for underwriting cyber risk coverage.</p> 
							<p>In the case of a pure form, the GWP is the only factor that determines capacity. In other words, if there are more insurance or reinsurance contracts available than there is risk to cover, then the market has an excess of capacity. However, if there are more risks to cover than there are contracts available, then the market is said to have a deficiency of capacity.</p> 
							<p>The amount of risk that a form or policy covers is called the total exposure. The GWP is used to determine the total exposure because it is an estimate of the worst-case scenario. In other words, it is the maximum amount of damage that could be caused by the event. For example, if a hurricane were to hit a city, the GWP would be used to estimate the total amount of damage that could be caused. This number would be used to determine the maximum amount of coverage that could be provided.</p> 
							<p>It's important to understand insurance capacity because it can impact the price of an individual’s policy. If there's a lack of capacity in the market, prices will be higher.</p>

							<h2>Who needs reinsurance capacity</h2>
							<p>Reinsurance companies, insurance companies, and self-insured organizations all need to have capacity. Reinsurers provide coverage for insurers. This is important because it helps to spread the risk. If one insurer has a lot of claims, the reinsurer can help to cover those claims. This protects the insurer from having to pay out all of the money themselves. Insurance companies need to have capacity so that they can provide coverage to their policyholders. Self-insured organizations also need to have capacity. These are organizations that don't carry insurance. Instead, they set aside money to pay for claims themselves.</p>

							<h2>How to get reinsurance capacity</h2>
							<p>There are a few ways to get reinsurance capacity. Let's take a look at each one.</p> 

							<h3>The first way is to get a reinsurance broker</h3>
							<p>A broker is a middleman who can help you to find a reinsurer. They'll work with you to find a company that's willing to provide the coverage you need. This can be a good option because it gives you access to a lot of different companies. And, it can be helpful to have someone who knows the market and can help you to negotiate a good deal. For instance, Lockton Re, is a brokerage firm that is committed to providing excellent client service and innovative technology that helps businesses optimize their risk. With over 125 years of experience in the industry, Lockton Re has the knowledge and resources to help. The company is the largest privately held insurance brokerage firm in the world and provides insurance, and risk management. Lockton Re is an example of a reinsurance broker but there are other firms who specialize in this.</p>

							<h3>Work with a company that connects capacity and insurtechs</h3>
							<p>Some companies work with insurtechs to help them find the capacity they need. These companies use technology to connect businesses with the right insurers. For instance, stere.io designed an ecosystem that connects "capacity seekers" such as MGAs, insurtechs or embedded insurance partners, with "capacity providers" like carriers and reinsurers. Their framework ensures reduction in placement times and our algorithm will support you by making "smart recommendations" to connect with the type of partner you're looking for. This can be a good option because it's a quick and easy way to find the capacity you need. When you work with a company like this, you can also get access to other resources that can help your business.</p> 


							<h3>Find a reinsurance partner on your own</h3>
							<p>If you don't want to use a broker or work with a company that connects businesses with insurers, you can find a reinsurance partner on your own. You can search for companies that provide the type of coverage you need. Then, you can reach out to them and see if they're willing to provide you with the coverage you need.</p>

							<p>Finding a reinsurer can be a challenge. But, it's important to make sure you have the coverage you need. If you don't have enough capacity, you could end up having to pay for claims yourself.</p>

							<p>A great example is Munich Re; a global provider of reinsurance, primary insurance and insurance-related risk solutions. Munich Re is likely an organization to consider for any Insurtech entrepreneur or company as they're always on the lookout for new, innovative insurance solutions that will help to shape the future of the industry.  Insurtech entrepreneurs can utilize the company's deep reinsurance capacity to develop sustainable value and new business opportunities. The ability to accelerate and launch new products at scale, along with our dedicated innovation teams, makes Munich Re partner for any Insurtech business.</p>
							<p>Another example is Swiss Re. Life & Health and Property & Casualty are both covered by the Swiss Reinsurance Business Unit. The company was founded in Zurich, Switzerland in 1863 and has been in the reinsurance business since then. It operates through more than 70 offices in over 30 countries. This makes it one of the largest reinsurance companies in the world.</p>

							<h3>Leverage a fronter/fronting company</h3>
							<p>This is an interesting option if you're looking for more flexibility or if you want to work with a company that has a lot of experience. A fronter/fronting company is a company that provides reinsurance coverage to another company. The fronting company then cedes the risk to the re-insurer. In other words the fronter provides the license(s) per line of business per state, typically taking 6% of gross written premium as a fee and typically the fronter takes on little to no risk. This enables an insurtech to go to market a bit quicker.  This can be a good option because it gives you more flexibility. You can work with a company that has a lot of experience and that can provide you with the coverage you need.</p>
							<p>For example, QBE is a fronter/fronting company. It's one of the largest global insurers and reinsurers. The company has operations in over 31 countries and offers a variety of insurance products, including General Liability, Motor, Financial Lines, WCA and Cyber.</p>

							<h3>Quota share treaty may be relevant</h3>
							<p>Think of a quota share treaty as a way to boost your company's capital while still sharing premiums and losses with another insurer. In this type of reinsurance contract, the insurer and reinsurer agree to share risk up to a predetermined maximum coverage percentage. By retaining some risk and premium, the insurer can preserve some capital. Overall, quota share reinsurance is a great way to protect your company's bottom line.</p>

							<h2>Best practices of reinsurance capacity</h2>
							<p>When expanding your business, it is best practice to get a reinsurance panel. A reinsurance panel is where you have multiple reinsurers all provide some percentage of capacity which is proportional to the risk they take. This allows for diversity and stability within your company. For example, Hippo has announced its diversified panel of reinsurers to support its plans for continued expansion in the year ahead. By having a reinsurance panel, Hippo is better equipped to handle any unforeseen bumps in the road.</p>
							<p>In other words, there is 100% of the pie to be distributed among the reinsurers. The insurer decides how much each reinsurer should get taking into account their risk appetite. </p>
							<p>This is beneficial for the company because it provides diversity and stability within your company. For example, if one reinsurer becomes insolvent, the others can still cover the losses. This is opposed to having just one reinsurer who would then be solely responsible for any losses. This is beneficial when market conditions change, and a reinsurer reduces the amount of capacity they will provide to your insurtech. For example, let’s say you have a panel made up of six capacity providers,  if one reinsurer only is covering 15% of your capacity and they wish to stop providing capacity altogether it is much easier to find someone else from your panel to increase the amount or another company from the market willing to provide 15% capacity as opposed to say 75%.</p>
