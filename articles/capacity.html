              <p>
                Insurance capacity is the amount of risk that an insurer is
                willing to take on. It's important to have a good understanding
                of this concept because it will help you determine the best way
                to protect your company's bottom line.

              <h2>Definition</h2>
              <p>
                Insurance capacity is a crucial concept in the insurance
                industry. It refers to the maximum amount of coverage that a
                company or the market can provide. For instance, after
                significant events like 9/11, there is often a shortage of
                insurance capacity in the market. This means that companies are
                unable or unwilling to offer the same level of coverage as
                before.
              </p>
              <p>
                When purchasing renters insurance, the insurer evaluates your
                personal risk profile and the available funds to cover potential
                claims. They also consider their future liabilities and the
                reserves necessary to meet claim obligations. These factors
                collectively determine the insurance policy prices, including
                renters' insurance and the extent of coverage a company can
                provide.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, significant events like hurricanes or terrorist attacks
                can lead to a surge in demand for insurance. As a result, the
                market may experience a shortage of insurance capacity, causing
                companies to be unable or unwilling to offer the same level of
                coverage as before. This shortage presents challenges for both
                insurtechs seeking coverage and consumers seeking to purchase or
                renew their policies. Ultimately, it results in higher prices
                and limited coverage options for consumers.

              <h2>Effects on gross written premium</h2>
              <p>
                The capacity to underwrite cyber risk coverage is not
                constrained by the availability of insurance or reinsurance
                contracts. Instead, it is influenced by the gross written
                premium (GWP) and the total exposure of the coverage. Insurance
                carriers are inclined to offer coverage to risks that have
                demonstrated improved security measures. However, risks that
                have not taken adequate steps to enhance their security posture
                may face policy cancellations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The occurrence of ransomware attacks in recent years has not
                affected insurance capacity directly. Nevertheless, it has
                resulted in increased premiums, subsequently expanding the
                capacity for underwriting cyber risk coverage.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the context of a pure form, capacity is solely determined by
                the GWP. When the number of available insurance or reinsurance
                contracts exceeds the risks that need coverage, the market has
                an excess of capacity. Conversely, if there are more risks to be
                covered than available contracts, the market is said to have a
                deficiency of capacity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The total exposure, which refers to the amount of risk covered
                by a form or policy, is established using the GWP. This
                estimation represents the worst-case scenario, indicating the
                maximum potential damage that could result from an event. For
                instance, in the case of a hurricane hitting a city, the GWP is
                utilized to estimate the overall damage that could occur. This
                calculation helps determine the maximum coverage amount that can
                be provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding insurance capacity is crucial as it can impact the
                pricing of individual policies. When there is a shortage of
                capacity in the market, prices tend to rise.

              <p>
                Reinsurance companies, insurance companies, and self-insured
                organizations all need to have capacity. Reinsurers provide
                coverage for insurers. This is important because it helps to
                spread the risk. If one insurer has a lot of claims, the
                reinsurer can help to cover those claims. This protects the
                insurer from having to pay out all of the money themselves.
                Insurance companies need to have capacity so that they can
                provide coverage to their policyholders. Self-insured
                organizations also need to have capacity. These are
                organizations that don't carry insurance. Instead, they set
                aside money to pay for claims themselves.

              <h2>How to get reinsurance capacity</h2>
              <p>
                There are a few ways to get reinsurance capacity. Let's take a
                look at each one.
              </p>

              <h3>The first way is to get a reinsurance broker</h3>
              <p>
                A broker is a middleman who can help you to find a reinsurer.
                They'll work with you to find a company that's willing to
                provide the coverage you need. This can be a good option because
                it gives you access to a lot of different companies. And, it can
                be helpful to have someone who knows the market and can help you
                to negotiate a good deal. For instance, Lockton Re is a
                brokerage firm that is committed to providing excellent client
                service and innovative technology that helps businesses optimize
                their risk. With over 125 years of experience in the industry,
                Lockton Re has the knowledge and resources to help. The company
                is the largest privately held insurance brokerage firm in the
                world and provides insurance, and risk management. Lockton Re is
                an example of a reinsurance broker but there are other firms who
                specialize in this.
              </p>

              <h3>Work with a company that connects capacity and insurtechs</h3>
              <p>
                Some companies work with insurtechs to help them find the
                capacity they need. These companies use technology to connect
                businesses with the right insurers. For instance, stere.io
                designed an ecosystem that connects "capacity seekers" such as
                MGAs, insurtechs or embedded insurance partners, with "capacity
                providers" like carriers and reinsurers. Their framework ensures
                reduction in placement times and our algorithm will support you
                by making "smart recommendations" to connect with the type of
                partner you're looking for. This can be a good option because
                it's a quick and easy way to find the capacity you need. When
                you work with a company like this, you can also get access to
                other resources that can help your business.
              </p>

              <h3>Find a reinsurance partner on your own</h3>
              <p>
                If you don't want to use a broker or work with a company that
                connects businesses with insurers, you can find a reinsurance
                partner on your own. You can search for companies that provide
                the type of coverage you need. Then, you can reach out to them
                and see if they're willing to provide you with the coverage you
                need.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finding a reinsurer can be a challenge. But, it's important to
                make sure you have the coverage you need. If you don't have
                enough capacity, you could end up having to pay for claims
                yourself.
              </p>

              <p>
                A great example is Munich Re; a global provider of reinsurance,
                primary insurance and insurance-related risk solutions. Munich
                Re is likely an organization to consider for any insurtech
                entrepreneur or company as they're always on the lookout for
                new, innovative insurance solutions that will help to shape the
                future of the industry. Insurtech entrepreneurs can utilize the
                company's deep reinsurance capacity to develop sustainable value
                and new business opportunities. The ability to accelerate and
                launch new products at scale, along with our dedicated
                innovation teams, makes Munich Re a strong partner for any insurtech
                business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another example is Swiss Re. Life & Health and Property &
                Casualty are both covered by the Swiss Reinsurance Business
                Unit. The company was founded in Zurich, Switzerland in 1863 and
                has been in the reinsurance business since then. It operates
                through more than 70 offices in over 30 countries. This makes it
                one of the largest reinsurance companies in the world.
              </p>

              <h3>Leverage a fronter/fronting company</h3>
              <p>
                This is an interesting option if you're looking for more
                flexibility or if you want to work with a company that has a lot
                of experience. A fronter/fronting company is a company that
                provides reinsurance coverage to another company. The fronting
                company then cedes the risk to the re-insurer. In other words
                the fronter provides the license(s) per line of business per
                state, typically taking 6% of gross written premium as a fee and
                typically the fronter takes on little to no risk. This enables
                an insurtech to go to market a bit quicker. This can be a good
                option because it gives you more flexibility. You can work with
                a company that has a lot of experience and that can provide you
                with the coverage you need.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, QBE is a fronter/fronting company. It's one of the
                largest global insurers and reinsurers. The company has
                operations in over 31 countries and offers a variety of
                insurance products, including General Liability, Motor,
                Financial Lines, WCA and Cyber.
              </p>

              <h3>Quota share treaty may be relevant</h3>
              <p>
                Think of a quota share treaty as a way to boost your company's
                capital while still sharing premiums and losses with another
                insurer. In this type of reinsurance contract, the insurer and
                reinsurer agree to share risk up to a predetermined maximum
                coverage percentage. By retaining some risk and premium, the
                insurer can preserve some capital. Overall, quota share
                reinsurance is a great way to protect your company's bottom
                line.

              <h2>Best practices</h2>
              <p>
                When expanding your business, it is best practice to get a
                reinsurance panel. A reinsurance panel is where you have
                multiple reinsurers all provide some percentage of capacity
                which is proportional to the risk they take. This allows for
                diversity and stability within your company. For example, Hippo
                has announced its diversified panel of reinsurers to support its
                plans for continued expansion in the year ahead. By having a
                reinsurance panel, Hippo is better equipped to handle any
                unforeseen bumps in the road.
              </p>
              <p>
                In other words, there is 100% of the pie to be distributed among
                the reinsurers. The insurer decides how much each reinsurer
                should get taking into account their risk appetite.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is beneficial for the company because it provides diversity
                and stability within your company. For example, if one reinsurer
                becomes insolvent, the others can still cover the losses. This
                is opposed to having just one reinsurer who would then be solely
                responsible for any losses. This is beneficial when market
                conditions change, and a reinsurer reduces the amount of
                capacity they will provide to your insurtech. For example, let’s
                say you have a panel made up of six capacity providers, if one
                reinsurer only is covering 15% of your capacity and they wish to
                stop providing capacity altogether it is much easier to find
                someone else from your panel to increase the amount or another
                company from the market willing to provide 15% capacity as
                opposed to say 75%.
